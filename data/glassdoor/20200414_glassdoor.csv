Why IDS?
<br/><br/>
Today's virtual training environments are segmented and simplistic-the opposite of the real-world's complex and integrated cyber battlefield. When even the most subtle input can influence every other facet of an operation, the one-dimensional training provided to our armed forces is not only outdated, it flat-out fails to equip them to outpace the operational tempo of the rapidly-evolving multi-domain battlefield. In the virtual arena, new threats emerge every day. IDS provides the tools for warfighters and cyber operators not just to prepare for them, but to anticipate the risks and to be ready for them when they arrive.
<br/><br/>
Social Media Environment and Internet Replication (SMEIR), a product of IDS International Government Services, is a digital training solution that provides a full-range, free-play, immersive, realistic and scalable operational practice environment in which warfighters simultaneously train on full-spectrum cyberspace operations and social media analytics during integrated and multi-dimensional exercises.
<br/><br/>
IDS International is seeking a Mid to Senior-level Artificial Intelligence / Natural Language Processing Software Engineer to join our growing team and build out the next generation of our internet simulation platform, called SMEIR. The Software Engineer will use machine learning to generate simulated content on various websites and social media platforms that will then be used for cyber-training exercises. In addition to generating new content, the Software Engineer will also analyze / ingest existing content. Understanding of sentiment analysis and content generation are required. Our engineering team uses a modified Scrum/Agile process. Candidate must be at ease working in an agile environment with little supervision. We use Slack, Jira and Git for project and software management. Our main office is in Arlington, VA with remote opportunities available for the right candidate.

<br/><br/>
Bain &amp; Company, a leading global strategy-consulting firm, serves clients on issues of strategy, operations, technology, organization and mergers and acquisitions. The firm was founded in 1973 on the principle that Bain consultants must measure their success by their clients' results. Delivering transformative results has always been a strength and competitive differentiator for Bain.
<br/><br/>
With 58 offices in 37 countries, Bain has worked the majority of the Global 500, thousands of major regional and local organizations, hundreds of nonprofits, and private equity funds representing 75 percent of global equity capital. We are proud of our clients' track record, like the fact that our public clients have historically outperformed the stock market 4 to 1.
<br/><br/>
Organizationally and culturally, Bain is very much a partnership. The environment is highly collegial, team-oriented, and apolitical. There is very little hierarchy and a great deal of autonomy - which translates into both entrepreneurial freedom and mutual respect and accountability.
<br/><br/>
Bain Automation Center of Excellence
<br/><br/>
The Bain Automation Center of Excellence is an integral part of Bain's Performance Improvement practice that helps companies grow earnings and outperform the competition. The Automation Center of Excellence works with Bain teams and clients to identify, build and deploy automation solutions across business processes, such as service operations and support functions (Finance, Human Resources and others).
<br/><br/>
<strong>Position Summary</strong>
<br/><br/>
Bain &amp; Company is looking to recruit an Automation Senior Specialist for our Automation Center of Excellence in North America.
<br/><br/>
The position will focus on helping our clients more effectively identify, design, and implement digital solutions across various business processes, in particular service operations and support functions (such as Finance or Human Resources). By digital solutions, we mean mature technologies, such as planning &amp; analytics in Finance, to emerging technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (including, but not limited to, Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and Machine Learning (ML)).
<br/><br/>
The position will require working with Bain clients to identify and prioritize opportunities (or use cases) to deploy digital technologies and automation in various business processes. The position will include supporting clients in profiling and recommending potential digital tool vendors for clients to work with. The position will require working with clients to pilot / prototype a proof of concept for identified digital solution(s). The position may require helping clients to design and implement internal organizations, such as Centers of Excellence or dedicated teams, to identify and deploy digital / automation solutions and client capability building in this space. Finally, the position will require working with clients to develop detailed project plans to implement digital solutions either in-house by the client and/or with a System Integrator partner selected by the client.
<br/><br/>
This individual should first have depth of knowledge and experience in various digital technologies, both mature and emerging technologies. This individual has experience working in software development teams to deploy automation, such as, but not limited to, RPA, machine learning, and other forms of AI, and advanced analytic solutions. This individual has both developed proof of concepts / pilots / demos and scaled these into larger scale implementations. This individual has strong knowledge of Agile software development methodologies. In addition, this individual carries at least one or more certifications in relevant software platforms.
<br/><br/>
This individual may or may not have deep functional knowledge of service operations or support functions initially and can acquire this knowledge while in the position. There is not an expectation that this individual will have full proficiency across every function. Ideally, this individual will have worked with clients in the past in piloting and/or implementing digital technologies. This individual will likely come from industry (e.g., IT in a corporation or supporting Finance or HR systems in a Finance or HR department), consulting companies, or System Integrators.
<br/><br/>
The general scope of the role will include approximately 80% of time focused on client activities with the remaining 20% focused on Automation Center of Excellence capability building.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses.

We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do &ndash; you can&rsquo;t put us in a box!
<br/><br/>
But &ldquo;Digital Transformation&rdquo; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
<br/><br/>
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
<br/><br/>
So, you have colorful hair? Don&rsquo;t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That&rsquo;s cool.

<br/><br/>
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we&rsquo;re &ldquo;old&rdquo; (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we&rsquo;re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do &ndash; you can&rsquo;t put us in a box!

But &ldquo;Digital Transformation&rdquo; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
<br/><br/>
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

<h2>We Are Cisco</h2><br/><br/>#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here&rsquo;s how we do it.
<br/><br/>
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we&rsquo;re &ldquo;old&rdquo; (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we&rsquo;re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do &ndash; you can&rsquo;t put us in a box!
<br/><br/>
But &ldquo;Digital Transformation&rdquo; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
<br/><br/>
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don&rsquo;t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That&rsquo;s cool.</div></div>

<br/><br/>
Ledgex is the first FinTech specifically focused on fixing the data quality challenges in multi-asset investing (think endowments, foundations, family offices). In a highly analytical industry, data quality is foundational. Today, in most offices, that foundation relies on layers of manual entry, carefully interconnected systems, reconciliation, and heroic effort.
<br/><br/>
We're building a better option, a solid foundation that provides better data quality and enables offices to more confidently and successfully manage complex portfolios. But we need more smart, user-focused, inquisitive, and talented engineers to continue delivering on that vision.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Why we need you</strong>
<br/><br/>
We're developing a suite to serve as that foundation, able to plug in to systems that clients already have or provide options when they don't. The team is expanding, relying on engineers like you that can dig in and learn the business, build software with an eye towards the user experience, operate at all levels of our stack, and grow with us. We're doing hard analytics for real people when muddy data provenance and low frequency is far too normal.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Here's what you'll be doing</strong>
<br/><br/>
In a typical month, you will collaborate on prototypes, develop features in React/Typescript/C#/SQL including automated tests and telemetry, peer review work from your teammates, deploy regularly to production (fully automated), and contribute to improving our tools and architecture.

<ul>
<li>Work with Product Managers and clients to develop the platform</li>
<li>Provide technical leadership for one of our suite modules and mentor peers</li>
<li>Build features, from concept and digging into details with Product Managers through development and successful operation in production</li>
<li>Take part in continuous improvement of our team, culture, processes, and software</li>
<li>Make us better by bringing complementary expertise to a team of fullstack engineers</li>
</ul>
<strong>To be successful, we believe you need experience in</strong>

<ul>
<li>Writing and shipping high quality software: from empty file to excited end user</li>
<li>Delivering features in complex web products over the full stack: web components and CSS with front-end business logic through API endpoints, server-side business logic, and data stores</li>
<li>Supporting your products in production: reactively by troubleshooting bugs and proactively by increasing visibility through tooling and improved telemetry</li>
<li>Working collaboratively with non-developers: joining your technical expertise with their domain expertise to deliver great solutions</li>
<li>Startups and/or small teams: We're a startup, we're pretty far along but we are still learning and refining direction as we go</li>
</ul>
Deeper expertise in one or two relevant areas, such as: UI/UX, accessibility, charting and graphics, front-end frameworks and architecture, back-end services and/or distributed systems, security (OWASP, etc) distributed logs (Kafka/Event Hubs/Kinesis), or Azure services.
<br/><br/>
<strong>We would be really interested if you could show expertise in</strong>

<ul>
<li>Institutional investing, with exposure to accounting and/or analytics related to alternative investments such as hedge funds, private equity and venture capital</li>
<li>Our technologies: ASP.Net Core, React, Typescript, HTML/CSS, MS SQL Server, Azure, Azure Storage + Event Hubs</li>
</ul>

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we&rsquo;re &ldquo;old&rdquo; (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we&rsquo;re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do &ndash; you can&rsquo;t put us in a box!

But &ldquo;Digital Transformation&rdquo; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
<br/><br/>
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

The team is responsible for application threat modeling, active penetration testing, design and oversight of secure development practices, development of tooling for exploit prevention and intrusion detection, and educating the organization on security best practices. More concisely, the security team is responsible for making sure the &quot;bad guys&quot; don't win.
<br/><br/>
We take security extremely seriously and do not drag our metaphorical feet on it. Yes, sometimes taking proper security measures can seem onerous or paranoid. But we've got our priorities straight.
<br/><br/>
As a senior security engineer, you will both directly work on object-level security challenges and also help create meta-level security principles to guide the organization as a whole. You are expected to have &quot;been around the block&quot; but to also keep up-to-date on novel developments in the security industry. You will be a mentor to engineers across the entire team.
<br/><br/>
Senior security engineers need to have broad and deep technical knowledge. Security cannot be reduced down to a static bag of tricks. It requires sophisticated knowledge of how all software works and mature mental models of how to reason about the security of complex systems. Senior security engineers already possess the knowledge and mental models necessary to be successful in their role and are constantly working to improve them.

<br/><br/>
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we&rsquo;re &ldquo;old&rdquo; (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we&rsquo;re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do &ndash; you can&rsquo;t put us in a box!
<br/><br/>
But &ldquo;Digital Transformation&rdquo; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
<br/><br/>
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don&rsquo;t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That&rsquo;s cool.</div></div>

<h2>We Are Cisco</h2><br/><br/>#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here&rsquo;s how we do it.
<br/><br/>
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we&rsquo;re &ldquo;old&rdquo; (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we&rsquo;re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do &ndash; you can&rsquo;t put us in a box!
<br/><br/>
But &ldquo;Digital Transformation&rdquo; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
<br/><br/>
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

We value top-notch collaboration and communication skills, both among internal teams and in how we interact with our users. We take care to balance and be responsive to the needs of our open source community as well as our enterprise level customers.
<br/><br/>
Engineering at HashiCorp is largely a remote team, and this role is no exception. We are looking for a Full-time Remote Employee within the US, UK, Canada, or the Netherlands. While prior experience working remotely isn't required, we are looking for team members who perform well given a high level of independence and autonomy.<br/><br/><h2><strong>Our Products</strong></h2><br/><br/>We build Consul, Nomad, Vault, Terraform, Packer, and Vagrant. Alongside that, we deploy enterprise products for each in a variety of different ways: licensed and unlicensed binaries, appliances to public cloud platforms, and hosted SaaS platforms. Our products help organizations of all sizes run any infrastructure for any application.<br/><br/><h2><strong>Our Team</strong></h2><br/><br/>Packaging and delivering Terraform Enterprise is a unique challenge, as it is deployed as a multi-tenant SaaS as well as a Private deployment. The Terraform Enterprise team is the team dedicated to taking the software running in our SaaS offering and deliver it into our Federal and Private customer's infrastructure.
<br/><br/>
The team is small, you'll be able to have a large impact on the project's architecture and direction. There are a host of interesting problems to tackle, stemming from the fact that this team needs to handle scale in three distinct dimensions:

<ul>
<li>A growing number of customer installations means we need features and automation to help sales and support teams give every one of our customers a wonderful experience with Terraform Enterprise.</li>
<li>We expect each installation to scale placing scaling challenges on the application and the infrastructure that we will need to address.</li>
<li>Each new customer environment we support introduces the potential of additional complexity - we'll need novel solutions across our entire pipeline to be able to regularly deliver releases across platforms with confidence.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>In this role, you can expect to:</strong></h2>


<ul>
<li>Extend and maintain the AWS Terraform provider to work with AWS' GovCloud and other environments.</li>
<li>Work with internal and external stakeholders to determine and prioritize new features and enhancements.</li>
<li>Advocate and support improvements to Terraform Core and the Terraform plugin SDK.</li>
<li>Design, build, iterate on, and ship the Terraform modules, machine images, system configuration, and software that hosts Terraform Enterprise in customer environments.</li>
<li>Switch fluidly between Infrastructure Engineering and Software Engineering tasks. For example: The results of your debugging investigation into a boot ordering issue one morning push us to decide to rewrite a Bash bootstrapping script in Go, a task you pick up that afternoon.</li>
<li>Work on the full stack of the system. For example: While working on a customer-reported issue, you discover that we need to handle an unforeseen error condition in one of our Go services. You author the fix, get it reviewed and deployed to the SaaS, and pull it in for the next Private release.</li>
<li>Help discover, design, and build the software that helps us support Private Terraform Enterprise customers (e.g. telemetry and diagnostics tooling designed for airgapped environments).</li>
<li>Working alongside our SRE team, help own operations, reliability, availability, and security of SaaS and private installations.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>You may be a good fit for our team if...</strong></h2>


<ul>
<li>You have a strong Software Engineering or DevOps background.</li>
<li>You have used Terraform &amp; enjoy working with Go (or experience with C/C++/C#)</li>
<li>You have experience working within the Federal Government either as a civilian, service member or a contractor.</li>
<li>You are familiar with infrastructure management concepts and tools (infrastructure as code, software defined networking, virtualization, and the tools used to operate and maintain related systems)</li>
<li>You have experience operating and maintaining production systems in a Linux and public cloud environment.</li>
<li>You relish in systems design problems that require you to pattern-match across multiple dimensions of complexity.</li>
<li>You get energy out of the prospect of diving into work that requires you to learn new things.</li>
<li>You understand that success in modern engineering requires navigating the tension between the overall technical ideal and the pragmatic next step. You are ready to help your team trend towards ideal solutions in the long term while also delivering concrete solutions to real problems in the near term.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>About the Application Process</strong></h2><br/><br/>All work requires excellent written communication skills, remote work doubly so. For this reason, <strong>we</strong> <strong>require</strong> <strong>a</strong> <strong>cover</strong> <strong>letter</strong> <strong>for</strong> <strong>your</strong> <strong>application</strong> <strong>to</strong> <strong>be</strong> <strong>considered</strong> <strong>complete.</strong>
<br/><br/>
In your cover letter, please describe what draws you to working at HashiCorp and to this role in particular. Specifics of your past experience are great to include, too.
<br/><br/>
<strong>At</strong> <strong>HashiCorp,</strong> <strong>we</strong> <strong>are</strong> <strong>committed</strong> <strong>to</strong> <strong>hiring</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>cultivating</strong> <strong>a</strong> <strong>diverse</strong> <strong>team.</strong> <strong>If</strong> <strong>you</strong> <strong>are</strong> <strong>on</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>fence</strong> <strong>about</strong> <strong>whether</strong> <strong>you</strong> <strong>meet</strong> <strong>our</strong> <strong>requirements,</strong> <strong>please</strong> <strong>apply</strong> <strong>anyway!</strong>

We are bringing together everyone involved in the closing process onto one shared, secure platform -- basically, we're making buying a home in America easier, safer, cheaper, and less painful by moving the process online! Qualia was founded in 2015 by Forbes 30 Under 30 Award recipients Nate Baker, Joel Gottsegen and Lucas Hansen.

<br/><br/>
Our security team is responsible for ensuring the security of both our technology and our organization as a whole. The team is responsible for application threat modeling, active penetration testing, design and oversight of secure development practices, development of tooling for exploit prevention and intrusion detection, and educating the organization on security best practices. More concisely, the security team is responsible for making sure the &quot;bad guys&quot; don't win.
<br/><br/>
We take security extremely seriously and do not drag our metaphorical feet on it. Yes, sometimes taking proper security measures can seem onerous or paranoid. But we've got our priorities straight.

As a senior security engineer, you will both directly work on object-level security challenges and also help create meta-level security principles to guide the organization as a whole. You are expected to have &quot;been around the block&quot; but to also keep up-to-date on novel developments in the security industry. You will be a mentor to engineers across the entire team.
<br/><br/>
Senior security engineers need to have broad and deep technical knowledge. Security cannot be reduced down to a static bag of tricks. It requires sophisticated knowledge of how all software works and mature mental models of how to reason about the security of complex systems.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we&rsquo;re &ldquo;old&rdquo; (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we&rsquo;re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do &ndash; you can&rsquo;t put us in a box!
<br/><br/>
But &ldquo;Digital Transformation&rdquo; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
<br/><br/>
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

We value top-notch collaboration and communication skills, both among internal teams and in how we interact with our users. We take care to balance and be responsive to the needs of our open source community as well as our enterprise level customers.
<br/><br/>
Engineering at HashiCorp is largely a remote team, and this role is no exception. We are looking for a Full-time Remote Employee within the US, UK, Canada, or the Netherlands. While prior experience working remotely isn't required, we are looking for team members who perform well given a high level of independence and autonomy.<br/><br/><h2><strong>Our Products</strong></h2><br/><br/>We build Consul, Nomad, Vault, Terraform, Packer, and Vagrant. Alongside that, we deploy enterprise products for each in a variety of different ways: licensed and unlicensed binaries, appliances to public cloud platforms, and hosted SaaS platforms. Our products help organizations of all sizes run any infrastructure for any application.<br/><br/><h2><strong>Our Team</strong></h2><br/><br/>Packaging and delivering Terraform Enterprise is a unique challenge, as it is deployed as a multi-tenant SaaS as well as a Private deployment. The Terraform Enterprise team is the team dedicated to taking the software running in our SaaS offering and deliver it into our Federal and Private customer's infrastructure.
<br/><br/>
The team is small, you'll be able to have a large impact on the project's architecture and direction. There are a host of interesting problems to tackle, stemming from the fact that this team needs to handle scale in three distinct dimensions:

<ul>
<li>A growing number of customer installations means we need features and automation to help sales and support teams give every one of our customers a wonderful experience with Terraform Enterprise.</li>
<li>We expect each installation to scale placing scaling challenges on the application and the infrastructure that we will need to address.</li>
<li>Each new customer environment we support introduces the potential of additional complexity - we'll need novel solutions across our entire pipeline to be able to regularly deliver releases across platforms with confidence.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>In this role, you can expect to:</strong></h2>


<ul>
<li>Extend and maintain the AWS Terraform provider to work with AWS' GovCloud and other environments.</li>
<li>Work with internal and external stakeholders to determine and prioritize new features and enhancements.</li>
<li>Advocate and support improvements to Terraform Core and the Terraform plugin SDK.</li>
<li>Design, build, iterate on, and ship the Terraform modules, machine images, system configuration, and software that hosts Terraform Enterprise in customer environments.</li>
<li>Switch fluidly between Infrastructure Engineering and Software Engineering tasks. For example: The results of your debugging investigation into a boot ordering issue one morning push us to decide to rewrite a Bash bootstrapping script in Go, a task you pick up that afternoon.</li>
<li>Work on the full stack of the system. For example: While working on a customer-reported issue, you discover that we need to handle an unforeseen error condition in one of our Go services. You author the fix, get it reviewed and deployed to the SaaS, and pull it in for the next Private release.</li>
<li>Help discover, design, and build the software that helps us support Private Terraform Enterprise customers (e.g. telemetry and diagnostics tooling designed for airgapped environments).</li>
<li>Working alongside our SRE team, help own operations, reliability, availability, and security of SaaS and private installations.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>You may be a good fit for our team if...</strong></h2>


<ul>
<li>You have a strong Software Engineering or DevOps background.</li>
<li>You have used Terraform &amp; enjoy working with Go (or experience with C/C++/C#)</li>
<li>You have experience working within the Federal Government either as a civilian, service member or a contractor.</li>
<li>You are familiar with infrastructure management concepts and tools (infrastructure as code, software defined networking, virtualization, and the tools used to operate and maintain related systems)</li>
<li>You have experience operating and maintaining production systems in a Linux and public cloud environment.</li>
<li>You relish in systems design problems that require you to pattern-match across multiple dimensions of complexity.</li>
<li>You get energy out of the prospect of diving into work that requires you to learn new things.</li>
<li>You understand that success in modern engineering requires navigating the tension between the overall technical ideal and the pragmatic next step. You are ready to help your team trend towards ideal solutions in the long term while also delivering concrete solutions to real problems in the near term.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>About the Application Process</strong></h2><br/><br/>All work requires excellent written communication skills, remote work doubly so. For this reason, <strong>we</strong> <strong>require</strong> <strong>a</strong> <strong>cover</strong> <strong>letter</strong> <strong>for</strong> <strong>your</strong> <strong>application</strong> <strong>to</strong> <strong>be</strong> <strong>considered</strong> <strong>complete.</strong>
<br/><br/>
In your cover letter, please describe what draws you to working at HashiCorp and to this role in particular. Specifics of your past experience are great to include, too.

As we grow, we're committed to proving that businesses can scale and be profitable while doing good in the world. For every pair of glasses we sell, a pair is distributed to someone in need&mdash;to date, that's over five million pairs.</div>
<br/>
<div>Of course, all work and no play makes a dull workplace. Who likes that? At Warby Parker, you can look forward to company outings, volunteering and learning opportunities, and just great company. Teammates can also connect around common interests, backgrounds, and identities, no matter their home base, through our various employee resource groups.
