10445,"Research Associate, Ctr for Network Medicine",Research Associate,"The UCSD Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine (CMM) is one of two basic science units in the School of Medicine where world-class researchers study fundamental cellular processes and pathways using a variety of techniques from classical genetics and fluorescence microscopy to high-throughput genomics, systems biology, and crystallography. Our 36 faculty and over 200 postdoctoral scholars, graduate students, and research staff work on the cutting edge of biology, cutting across fields from basic biochemistry and genetics to genomics, systems biology and stem cell biology. The faculty also play a major role in medical and graduate student training, providing educational and programmatic offerings that span several disciplines and provide diversity to meet the interests of a broad spectrum of students and scholars. We constantly seek to recruit highly motivated, technologically-advanced, and deeply interested individuals who are ready to become a part of our dynamic research and educational environment.
The Center for Network Medicine [www.cnetmed.ucsd.edu] is striving towards a goal of understanding the fundamental principles that allow eukaryotic cells to do their business, i.e., iteratively sense, decide, act and learn/adapt. We hypothesize that they do so through an ad hoc molecular interaction network whose architectural principles and computational rules are similar to those used in the layered communication systems in the engineering world. These rules enable noise reduction, error minimization, shielding and encapsulation of breakdowns, control of delays and state explosion, etc. Success in decoding these fundamental rules should not only enable us to complete and 'clean up' the existing incomplete and messy biological networks, but also use these network for simulating and predicting cell behavior. This will usher a new era in network-based diagnostic tools and network-resetting therapeutics for major diseases. On the flip side, knowing how a cell autonomously carries out its business will provide insights into designing new kinds of self-organizing networks (SON) and provide a novel paradigm (beyond artificial neural networks) for developing Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Under close supervision, the incumbent will be supervised in performing basic molecular and cell biology techniques. Techniques include being trained in tissue culture, transfections, expression of proteins in bacteria and mammalian cells, immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, protein purification, protein-protein interactions, real-time quantitative PCR (QPCR), mutagenesis, ELISA studies, reverse transcription QPCR, Southerns, Northerns, synthesis of radioactive probes for hybridization, plasmid subcloning, GFP-fusion protein construction, lambda and M13 subcloning, cell culture, animal cell transfection, rho-zero cell PEG fusions, retrovirus gene transduction, RNAi knockdowns, etc.
Under close supervision, the research associate will also learn to perform immunofluorescent microscopy and live cell imaging (Mitotracker, reactive oxygen sensitive probes, etc) as well as be trained on how to use and maintain laboratory equipment. This position will also be trained to follow safety, environmental, and/or infection control standards. The lab assistant will also will participate in basic animal studies including performing tail tip DNA analysis, necropsy, tissue trimming and histology. The lab assistant will be trained in courses relevant to biosafety, radiation safety, animal welfare, and notebooks of new techniques.
Specifically, this position may involve: assisting in the establishment of CNetMed’s IHC Core; supporting multiple ongoing cell and molecular biology tasks on multiple projects; and assisting in ongoing animal disease model studies within CNetMed.
MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS
Theoretical knowledge of a life science in a field related to the research being conducted or an equivalent combination of education and experience. Related fields may include any of the following fields of study: molecular biology, genetics, immunology, zoology, and biochemistry.

Animal expertise (breeding, handling, experimentation, genotyping, and weaning).

Proven ability to prepare solutions. Demonstrated knowledge of basic chemistry and math required for preparing solutions.

Capable of operating and maintaining lab equipment such as confocal and quantitative fluorescent microscopes, centrifuges, spectrophotometers, flow cytometer, and scintillation counter.

Ability to maintain laboratory supplies, keeping written records, and data collection.

Basic knowledge of basic chemistry and math required for preparing solutions.

Skill and ability to operate various lab instruments.
Experience with the operation of a personal computer and software application, such as Filemaker, MS Word and Excel. Experience with the Mac platform and applications is preferred over PC.
Strong communication skills (both verbal and written) needed to interact professionally and effectively in the work environment with all levels including faculty, senior researchers, graduate students, undergraduates and those from various backgrounds with tact and diplomacy.

Ability to care for small lab animals, as well as working with animal and human tissues.

Ability to read, and learn to interpret and apply protocols in conducting research. Ability in following stepwise experimental protocols.
Good organizational skills to order and maintain lab equipment and supplies. Ability to perform general lab maintenance, including cleaning and restocking supplies. Experienced working and maintaining a sterile environment.

PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS
Experience with molecular biology techniques.

Cell culture experience.

Familiarity working in a laboratory that performs research to understand how lymphocytes develop and survive and how this complex regulation can impact various diseases in the human population.

Experience with mouse handling, surgeries, anesthesia, injections, euthanasia, and tissue harvest.

Knowledge of UCSD Environmental Health and Safety requirements. Knowledge of radiation safety and biosafety techniques and practices. Experience to work with chemical, radioisotope, and biological hazards and to recognize safety problems.

SPECIAL CONDITIONS
Employment is subject to a criminal background check.
Must be willing to work overtime if necessary.

Must be willing to work with small animals.

Must be willing to work in areas that may use pathogenic microbes for experiments.
Must be willing to work with human samples and stem cell-based tools/techniques."
