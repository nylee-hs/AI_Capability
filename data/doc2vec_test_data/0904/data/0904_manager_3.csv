7362,M,Director of Econometrics,Director - Econometrics,"Bliss Point Media is a rapidly growing performance media advertising agency startup based in Santa Monica that combines world-class media capabilities with cutting-edge statistics and computer science. Using technology as a differentiator, Bliss Point Media brings modern statistical and computational techniques to bear on our clients' biggest marketing opportunities across linear TV and streaming/OTT video platforms. Our approach provides our clients with unique and powerful tools to maximize the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns while providing an experience of strategic depth and flawless execution. We work with some of the world's most recognizable new brands as well as established companies that want to rewrite their media playbook.

The Role

Bliss Point's clients are performance advertisers, which is to say they make investments with the expectation of a quantifiable return. Our job is to quantify those returns with maximal precision, and steward our clients' investments so as to make the return/investment ratio as attractive as possible.

Bliss Point's approach to this challenge involves deploying a suite of algorithms that are both purpose-built and general purpose; that is, specifically designed for a given context, but broadly applicable to different advertisers operating within that context.

Surrounding this core set of consistent, repeated questions, there are innumerable auxiliary questions: Should we test incrementality using an A/B audience holdout or a geographic holdout? How many impressions do we need to achieve statistical significance for our incrementality test, and how should those impressions be allocated between the control and exposed groups? What is the optimal frequency when we're running a promotion versus not? Are we better off ramping up media some time in advance of a promotion, or in a just-in-time fashion? When we ramp spend on TV, how much extra branded search spend should we budget for? Ad infinitum.

This role will touch both hemispheres of Bliss Point's analysis: core algorithms for repeatable decisions, and data science applications to everyday marketing problems. In addition to analytical work, the role will have a significant interpersonal aspect: communicating methods and findings to clients and contributing to the learning & development track for the client strategy team. The Director of Econometrics will report to the CEO.

Background & Competencies

Degree in statistics, data science, applied math, economics, or related field
Strong foundations in probability theory and econometrics
3+ years of experience in applied data science
Significant practical experience with R/Python and SQL
Lots of hands-on experience with real-world, imperfect data, and a zeal for turning disorder into sensible order
Greater emphasis on: experimental design, hypothesis testing, observational and quasi-experimental measurement techniques
Lesser emphasis on: big data, deep learning, artificial intelligence, etc.
A love of solving puzzles with data!

Compensation

Bliss Point is a startup, and we're looking for someone who finds that exciting rather than intimidating. We're profitable and will offer a very competitive total compensation package to the right candidate, with a salary range from $140,000-$160,000 to start depending on skills and experience, plus stock options and variable compensation.

Benefits

Bliss Point offers full medical benefits (Blue Shield of California PPO plans), including dental and vision coverage. After 60 days of employment, you will be eligible for our uncapped vacation policy. After 6 months you would become eligible for the BPM 401K. The company also offers parking, a gym membership from Burn Fitness in Santa Monica, cell phone reimbursement and bonus opportunities, paid out based on individual and company performance on a quarterly basis.

8818,M,Manager of Econometrics,"Manager, Econometrics","Bliss Point Media is a rapidly growing performance media advertising agency startup based in Santa Monica that combines world-class media capabilities with cutting-edge statistics and computer science. Using technology as a differentiator, Bliss Point Media brings modern statistical and computational techniques to bear on our clients' biggest marketing opportunities across linear TV and streaming/OTT video platforms. Our approach provides our clients with unique and powerful tools to maximize the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns while providing an experience of strategic depth and flawless execution. We work with some of the world's most recognizable new brands as well as established companies that want to rewrite their media playbook.

The Role
Bliss Point's clients are performance advertisers, which is to say they make investments with the expectation of a quantifiable return. Our job is to quantify those returns with maximal precision, and steward our clients' investments so as to make the return/investment ratio as attractive as possible.

Bliss Point's approach to this challenge involves deploying a suite of algorithms that are both purpose-built and general purpose; that is, specifically designed for a given context, but broadly applicable to different advertisers operating within that context.

Surrounding this core set of consistent, repeated questions, there are innumerable auxiliary questions: Should we test incrementality using an A/B audience holdout or a geographic holdout? How many impressions do we need to achieve statistical significance for our incrementality test, and how should those impressions be allocated between the control and exposed groups? What is the optimal frequency when we're running a promotion versus not? Are we better off ramping up media some time in advance of a promotion, or in a just-in-time fashion? When we ramp spend on TV, how much extra branded search spend should we budget for? Ad infinitum.

This role will be auxiliary to the Client Strategy team, providing econometric support across the client base to bolster strategy and execution of campaign investments. In addition to analytical work, the role will have a significant interpersonal aspect: communicating methods and findings to clients, and contributing to the learning & development track for the client strategy team. The Econometrics Manager will report to the Director of Econometrics.

Background & Competencies

Degree in statistics, data science, applied math, economics, or related field

Strong foundations in probability theory and econometrics

0 - 3 years of experience in applied data science

Significant practical experience with R/Python and SQL

Lots of hands-on experience with real-world, imperfect data, and a zeal for turning disorder into sensible order

Greater emphasis on: experimental design, hypothesis testing, observational and quasi-experimental measurement techniques

Lesser emphasis on: big data, deep learning, artificial intelligence, etc.

A love of solving puzzles with data!

Compensation
Bliss Point is a startup, and we're looking for someone who finds that exciting rather than intimidating. We're profitable and will offer a very competitive total compensation package to the right candidate, with a salary range from $80,000-$100,000 to start depending on skills and experience, plus stock options and variable compensation.

Benefits

Bliss Point offers full medical benefits (Blue Shield of California PPO plans), including dental and vision coverage. After 60 days of employment, you will be eligible for our uncapped vacation policy. After 6 months you would become eligible for the BPM 401K. The company also offers parking, a gym membership from Burn Fitness in Santa Monica, cell phone reimbursement and bonus opportunities, paid out based on individual and company performance on a quarterly basis.

All applicants must be authorized to work in the United States. The company does not offer visa sponsorship at this time."
