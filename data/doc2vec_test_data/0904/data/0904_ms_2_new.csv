Over the past 25 years, we grew from startup to $2.75 billion in annual revenue and are confident that we still have a huge, multi-year growth opportunity ahead of us. Our confidence is driven by two primary factors: firstly, ~80% of the market segment for small businesses’ marketing materials is still served through traditional offline channels, often lacking the convenience and cost advantages from greater scale that we can offer our customers. Secondly, there is a significant opportunity to accelerate our activity in adjacent product segments such as packaging, apparel, signage, or corporate line of business accounts. We are a profitable business with an entrepreneurial mindset, and throughout our history we have proven our commitment to investing for long-term horizons.

162,7362,M,Director of Econometrics,Director - Econometrics,"Bliss Point Media is a rapidly growing performance media advertising agency startup based in Santa Monica that combines world-class media capabilities with cutting-edge statistics and computer science. Using technology as a differentiator, Bliss Point Media brings modern statistical and computational techniques to bear on our clients' biggest marketing opportunities across linear TV and streaming/OTT video platforms. Our approach provides our clients with unique and powerful tools to maximize the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns while providing an experience of strategic depth and flawless execution. We work with some of the world's most recognizable new brands as well as established companies that want to rewrite their media playbook.

The Role

Bliss Point's clients are performance advertisers, which is to say they make investments with the expectation of a quantifiable return. Our job is to quantify those returns with maximal precision, and steward our clients' investments so as to make the return/investment ratio as attractive as possible.

Bliss Point's approach to this challenge involves deploying a suite of algorithms that are both purpose-built and general purpose; that is, specifically designed for a given context, but broadly applicable to different advertisers operating within that context.

Surrounding this core set of consistent, repeated questions, there are innumerable auxiliary questions: Should we test incrementality using an A/B audience holdout or a geographic holdout? How many impressions do we need to achieve statistical significance for our incrementality test, and how should those impressions be allocated between the control and exposed groups? What is the optimal frequency when we're running a promotion versus not? Are we better off ramping up media some time in advance of a promotion, or in a just-in-time fashion? When we ramp spend on TV, how much extra branded search spend should we budget for? Ad infinitum.

This role will touch both hemispheres of Bliss Point's analysis: core algorithms for repeatable decisions, and data science applications to everyday marketing problems. In addition to analytical work, the role will have a significant interpersonal aspect: communicating methods and findings to clients and contributing to the learning & development track for the client strategy team. The Director of Econometrics will report to the CEO.

Background & Competencies

Degree in statistics, data science, applied math, economics, or related field
Strong foundations in probability theory and econometrics
3+ years of experience in applied data science
Significant practical experience with R/Python and SQL
Lots of hands-on experience with real-world, imperfect data, and a zeal for turning disorder into sensible order
Greater emphasis on: experimental design, hypothesis testing, observational and quasi-experimental measurement techniques
Lesser emphasis on: big data, deep learning, artificial intelligence, etc.
A love of solving puzzles with data!

Compensation

Bliss Point is a startup, and we're looking for someone who finds that exciting rather than intimidating. We're profitable and will offer a very competitive total compensation package to the right candidate, with a salary range from $140,000-$160,000 to start depending on skills and experience, plus stock options and variable compensation.

Benefits

Bliss Point offers full medical benefits (Blue Shield of California PPO plans), including dental and vision coverage. After 60 days of employment, you will be eligible for our uncapped vacation policy. After 6 months you would become eligible for the BPM 401K. The company also offers parking, a gym membership from Burn Fitness in Santa Monica, cell phone reimbursement and bonus opportunities, paid out based on individual and company performance on a quarterly basis.

172,8818,M,Manager of Econometrics,"Manager, Econometrics","Bliss Point Media is a rapidly growing performance media advertising agency startup based in Santa Monica that combines world-class media capabilities with cutting-edge statistics and computer science. Using technology as a differentiator, Bliss Point Media brings modern statistical and computational techniques to bear on our clients' biggest marketing opportunities across linear TV and streaming/OTT video platforms. Our approach provides our clients with unique and powerful tools to maximize the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns while providing an experience of strategic depth and flawless execution. We work with some of the world's most recognizable new brands as well as established companies that want to rewrite their media playbook.

The Role
Bliss Point's clients are performance advertisers, which is to say they make investments with the expectation of a quantifiable return. Our job is to quantify those returns with maximal precision, and steward our clients' investments so as to make the return/investment ratio as attractive as possible.

Bliss Point's approach to this challenge involves deploying a suite of algorithms that are both purpose-built and general purpose; that is, specifically designed for a given context, but broadly applicable to different advertisers operating within that context.

Surrounding this core set of consistent, repeated questions, there are innumerable auxiliary questions: Should we test incrementality using an A/B audience holdout or a geographic holdout? How many impressions do we need to achieve statistical significance for our incrementality test, and how should those impressions be allocated between the control and exposed groups? What is the optimal frequency when we're running a promotion versus not? Are we better off ramping up media some time in advance of a promotion, or in a just-in-time fashion? When we ramp spend on TV, how much extra branded search spend should we budget for? Ad infinitum.

This role will be auxiliary to the Client Strategy team, providing econometric support across the client base to bolster strategy and execution of campaign investments. In addition to analytical work, the role will have a significant interpersonal aspect: communicating methods and findings to clients, and contributing to the learning & development track for the client strategy team. The Econometrics Manager will report to the Director of Econometrics.

Background & Competencies

Degree in statistics, data science, applied math, economics, or related field

Strong foundations in probability theory and econometrics

0 - 3 years of experience in applied data science

Significant practical experience with R/Python and SQL

Lots of hands-on experience with real-world, imperfect data, and a zeal for turning disorder into sensible order

Greater emphasis on: experimental design, hypothesis testing, observational and quasi-experimental measurement techniques

Lesser emphasis on: big data, deep learning, artificial intelligence, etc.

A love of solving puzzles with data!

Compensation
Bliss Point is a startup, and we're looking for someone who finds that exciting rather than intimidating. We're profitable and will offer a very competitive total compensation package to the right candidate, with a salary range from $80,000-$100,000 to start depending on skills and experience, plus stock options and variable compensation.

Benefits

Bliss Point offers full medical benefits (Blue Shield of California PPO plans), including dental and vision coverage. After 60 days of employment, you will be eligible for our uncapped vacation policy. After 6 months you would become eligible for the BPM 401K. The company also offers parking, a gym membership from Burn Fitness in Santa Monica, cell phone reimbursement and bonus opportunities, paid out based on individual and company performance on a quarterly basis.

All applicants must be authorized to work in the United States.

Company Overview
STILMAN Advanced Strategies develops software based on Linguistic Geometry (LG), a unique Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach. Our core technology generates predictive, tactically correct Courses of Action (COAs) that dynamically adapt in response to changes in missions and actions taken by the intelligent opposition. These tools support mission planning, rehearsal, training and execution use cases for military commanders across echelons and services. Our applications have been shown to deliver unique value to the warfighter due to the quality of generated COAs, UX/UI design that makes it easy to fully comprehend complex COA results and to define mission inputs, as well as ease of deployment and integration with other system with well-defined modern APIs.

Our small, distributed team has been developing and continually improving these software applications since 1999.

POSITION: Military Veteran Modeling & Simulation Leader. Small company style so you'll wear Product Owner, Project Manager and Software System Engineer hats
LOCATION: Work Remote- work from anywhere USA. Ideal cities; Washington, DC area, Orlando FL, Denver, CO. US Citizenship is required. This position requires the ability to obtain and maintain a security clearance during early employment which we sponsor.

Company Overview
STILMAN Advanced Strategies develops software based on Linguistic Geometry (LG), a unique Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach. Our core technology generates predictive, tactically correct Courses of Action (COAs) that dynamically adapt in response to changes in missions and actions taken by the intelligent opposition. These tools support mission planning, rehearsal, training and execution use cases for military commanders across echelons and services. Our applications have been shown to deliver unique value to the warfighter due to the quality of generated COAs, UX/UI design that makes it easy to fully comprehend complex COA results and to define mission inputs, as well as ease of deployment and integration with other system with well-defined modern APIs.

Our small, distributed team has been developing and continually improving these software applications since 1999. We pride ourselves on the quality of our software and we are excited as we continue this development with US Navy, US Army, Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and other agencies to further enhance, integrate, and deploy these products.

The Role: Military Veteran Modeling & Simulation Leader
We are looking to bring on a dedicated Veteran Leader (aka Product Owner / Software System Engineer) to work closely with our software developers on our primary software applications that include web app that leverages modern UI technologies, UX concepts, GIS/mapping, communications protocols, data formats, and military concepts, as well as backend components with custom Artificial Intelligence (AI) engine, military modeling and simulation framework (M&S), and integration capabilities for our own front end and for 3rd party systems. This web-based system encompasses a large feature set for map-centric scenario construction and editing, 2D and 3D animated visualization, real time collaboration, COA analytics, wargaming, and integration with other military and simulation systems. As the feature set grows, we need to ensure that user experience for both basic and advanced users is as smooth as possible, little training is needed, and the military users can intuitively use the tool to help them think about tactics rather than spending their time thinking about how to use the tool.

In this role, you will become the Subject Matter Expert (SME) of military Courses of Action analysis, wargaming and simulation software systems. Prior military tactical experience and/or understanding of the military operations and capabilities would be a strong asset, although not required.

You will communicate with the clients to assist with gathering feedback and new requirements and decomposing them into actionable, well-defined user stories and tasks. You will work with the development team to design solutions to customer needs, help document the system and feature design, and communicate it with key stakeholders outside of the company. You will take part in design of UI/UX and military modeling for new features or redesigning existing ones based on customer needs, feedback, and your own recommendations for usability improvements. You will work directly with the development team to manage and prioritize backlog, track developer progress and guide them in making decisions to ensure end software closely matches user needs. As a superuser of our software you will use the software, communicate insights for the development team, and demonstrate the functionality to the current or prospective customers. You will support our integration efforts through close communication with the product owners and software engineers of the other companies to make sure that the end product fits customer needs, and to represent and advocate for the technical approach designed by our development team.

About Instrumental:
Instrumental is creating the future of manufacturing, empowering hardware companies to optimize their factories through the use of artificial intelligence. Thanks to Instrumental, companies can:

increase yields (the percent of goods passing inspection);
decrease dark yield (the escape of goods that should have failed inspection); and,
trace everything (to narrowly scope recalls to only those goods affected).

Our product is delighting customers, who now have access to technology that produces results previously unattainable. The Instrumental customer list is growing across a diverse set of manufacturing applications, and we are asking you to help us scale to the needs of that entire market.

With ~30 people we are a small but mighty team, so if you are looking for a place where you can work with friendly people and have outsize impact on entire industries then keep reading!

About the role:
As a full stack JavaScript engineer at Instrumental, you'll apply your expertise in application development to implement and guide the roadmap of our factory software running on the most secure assembly lines of the world. We deploy fast -- the software you write on Monday will be executing in mass production by Friday.

Our factory stack is: Angular/Typescript for UI, NodeJS for local backend, C++ for hardware integrations (surfaced as node modules), and Docker for application delivery and service orchestration.

This isn't a solo job -- you will be working together not only with fellow engineers developing the factory application, but with backend developers, operations, and product staff in a quest to improve the way that things are made, wherever they are made.

What you can expect in the first few months:

Designing and implementing the frontend and local backend for workflows to be used by assembly line workers.
Working with the cloud platform and web app teams to provide more control over and visibility into factory systems from thousands of miles away.
Partnering with our ML team to deliver key defect detection features onto the hardware assembly lines of the world.
Using instrumentation and automated testing to maintain and improve software performance.

Requirements:

Three or more years driving development of web applications with user-facing components.
Demonstrated experience with: HTML/CSS/JS, NodeJS, integrating with web APIs (GraphQL, REST).
Comfort with: Linux, networking
Demonstrated ability to lead teams in speccing & delivering software projects while keeping stakeholders in the loop.
A relentless desire to automate (or the foundation and desire to learn!).
Ability to effectively communicate complex ideas to technical and non-technical individuals alike.

More details on requirements:

HTML/CSS/JS: although we automate as much as we can, there are points that require input from, and deliver insights to, personnel on the assembly line, and you should be comfortable shipping code for their use.
NodeJS: you should be able to add the backend endpoints and business logic needed to enable new frontend features.
Demonstrated Leadership: the people who thrive here tend to be self-driven individuals who know when to seek guidance, but can also work with a team to autonomously tackle large projects.

Relevant Technobabble:

Labelbox is building software infrastructure for industrial data science teams to do data labeling for the training of neural networks. When we build software, we take for granted the existence of collaborative tools to write and debug code. The machine learning workflow has no standard tooling for labeling data, storing it, debugging models and then continually improving model accuracy. Enter Labelbox. Labelbox's vision is to become the default software for data scientists to manage data and train neural networks in the same way that GitHub or text editors are defaults for software engineers.

429,8888,S,"Senior Software Engineer, Records","Senior Software Engineer, Records","Our mission is to protect life.
We’re out to make the world a safer place by solving big problems and taking on the public safety challenges of our time. From our company's inception building the TASER device to a full suite of hardware and software solutions, we are focused on providing police agencies with the state-of-the-art devices and services they need to successfully serve and protect us. In the next few years, we're going to eliminate the burden of paperwork in policing, so officers can increase the time they spend building relationships and serving in their communities. We’ll put video at the heart of the police record so our justice system can get to the truth faster. And we won't stop innovating until the bullet is rendered obsolete.

It’s a big mission, but it’s one we’ll pursue relentlessly every single day.

Your Impact
Today, public safety officers spend up to 2/3 of their time on the job filling out paperwork. Not only is this tedious for officers, but the never-ending pile of paperwork reduces the amount of time they can spend out in the field, protecting their communities. That’s why we’re building Axon Records, a brand-new cloud-based web platform that cuts down on paperwork so that officers can spend more time prioritizing the safety of our communities.

As a Senior Software Engineer on the Axon Records Search team, you will build a high-performance, scalable search platform to equip law enforcement officers with the information they need to document critical incidents, report their interactions, and protect their communities. And that’s just the beginning. By building a data analytics platform to gather real-time insights from criminal data to help agencies solve crimes and keep patrol officers safe in the field, you will help transform the future of public safety.

Imagine the year 2030. Advanced technology has automated more and more routine tasks to put officers back in the community, dramatically improving the quality and safety of our lives. Artificial Intelligence connects the dots and surfaces insights to help prevent crime and keep officers and citizens informed and protected.

Sound exciting? We think so too. Check out this short video to learn more about where we're heading, and apply now to join a team that's turning this vision into a reality.
