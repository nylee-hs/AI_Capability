7362,Director of Econometrics,Director - Econometrics,"Bliss Point Media is a rapidly growing performance media advertising agency startup based in Santa Monica that combines world-class media capabilities with cutting-edge statistics and computer science. Using technology as a differentiator, Bliss Point Media brings modern statistical and computational techniques to bear on our clients' biggest marketing opportunities across linear TV and streaming/OTT video platforms. Our approach provides our clients with unique and powerful tools to maximize the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns while providing an experience of strategic depth and flawless execution. We work with some of the world's most recognizable new brands as well as established companies that want to rewrite their media playbook.

The Role

Bliss Point's clients are performance advertisers, which is to say they make investments with the expectation of a quantifiable return. Our job is to quantify those returns with maximal precision, and steward our clients' investments so as to make the return/investment ratio as attractive as possible.

Bliss Point's approach to this challenge involves deploying a suite of algorithms that are both purpose-built and general purpose; that is, specifically designed for a given context, but broadly applicable to different advertisers operating within that context.

Surrounding this core set of consistent, repeated questions, there are innumerable auxiliary questions: Should we test incrementality using an A/B audience holdout or a geographic holdout? How many impressions do we need to achieve statistical significance for our incrementality test, and how should those impressions be allocated between the control and exposed groups? What is the optimal frequency when we're running a promotion versus not? Are we better off ramping up media some time in advance of a promotion, or in a just-in-time fashion? When we ramp spend on TV, how much extra branded search spend should we budget for? Ad infinitum.

This role will touch both hemispheres of Bliss Point's analysis: core algorithms for repeatable decisions, and data science applications to everyday marketing problems. In addition to analytical work, the role will have a significant interpersonal aspect: communicating methods and findings to clients and contributing to the learning & development track for the client strategy team. The Director of Econometrics will report to the CEO.

Background & Competencies

Degree in statistics, data science, applied math, economics, or related field
Strong foundations in probability theory and econometrics
3+ years of experience in applied data science
Significant practical experience with R/Python and SQL
Lots of hands-on experience with real-world, imperfect data, and a zeal for turning disorder into sensible order
Greater emphasis on: experimental design, hypothesis testing, observational and quasi-experimental measurement techniques
Lesser emphasis on: big data, deep learning, artificial intelligence, etc.
A love of solving puzzles with data!

Compensation

Bliss Point is a startup, and we're looking for someone who finds that exciting rather than intimidating. We're profitable and will offer a very competitive total compensation package to the right candidate, with a salary range from $140,000-$160,000 to start depending on skills and experience, plus stock options and variable compensation.

Benefits

Bliss Point offers full medical benefits (Blue Shield of California PPO plans), including dental and vision coverage. After 60 days of employment, you will be eligible for our uncapped vacation policy. After 6 months you would become eligible for the BPM 401K. The company also offers parking, a gym membership from Burn Fitness in Santa Monica, cell phone reimbursement and bonus opportunities, paid out based on individual and company performance on a quarterly basis.

8818,Manager of Econometrics,"Manager, Econometrics","Bliss Point Media is a rapidly growing performance media advertising agency startup based in Santa Monica that combines world-class media capabilities with cutting-edge statistics and computer science. Using technology as a differentiator, Bliss Point Media brings modern statistical and computational techniques to bear on our clients' biggest marketing opportunities across linear TV and streaming/OTT video platforms. Our approach provides our clients with unique and powerful tools to maximize the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns while providing an experience of strategic depth and flawless execution. We work with some of the world's most recognizable new brands as well as established companies that want to rewrite their media playbook.

The Role
Bliss Point's clients are performance advertisers, which is to say they make investments with the expectation of a quantifiable return. Our job is to quantify those returns with maximal precision, and steward our clients' investments so as to make the return/investment ratio as attractive as possible.

Bliss Point's approach to this challenge involves deploying a suite of algorithms that are both purpose-built and general purpose; that is, specifically designed for a given context, but broadly applicable to different advertisers operating within that context.

Surrounding this core set of consistent, repeated questions, there are innumerable auxiliary questions: Should we test incrementality using an A/B audience holdout or a geographic holdout? How many impressions do we need to achieve statistical significance for our incrementality test, and how should those impressions be allocated between the control and exposed groups? What is the optimal frequency when we're running a promotion versus not? Are we better off ramping up media some time in advance of a promotion, or in a just-in-time fashion? When we ramp spend on TV, how much extra branded search spend should we budget for? Ad infinitum.

This role will be auxiliary to the Client Strategy team, providing econometric support across the client base to bolster strategy and execution of campaign investments. In addition to analytical work, the role will have a significant interpersonal aspect: communicating methods and findings to clients, and contributing to the learning & development track for the client strategy team. The Econometrics Manager will report to the Director of Econometrics.

Background & Competencies

Degree in statistics, data science, applied math, economics, or related field

Strong foundations in probability theory and econometrics

0 - 3 years of experience in applied data science

Significant practical experience with R/Python and SQL

Lots of hands-on experience with real-world, imperfect data, and a zeal for turning disorder into sensible order

Greater emphasis on: experimental design, hypothesis testing, observational and quasi-experimental measurement techniques

Lesser emphasis on: big data, deep learning, artificial intelligence, etc.

A love of solving puzzles with data!

Compensation
Bliss Point is a startup, and we're looking for someone who finds that exciting rather than intimidating. We're profitable and will offer a very competitive total compensation package to the right candidate, with a salary range from $80,000-$100,000 to start depending on skills and experience, plus stock options and variable compensation.

Benefits

Bliss Point offers full medical benefits (Blue Shield of California PPO plans), including dental and vision coverage. After 60 days of employment, you will be eligible for our uncapped vacation policy. After 6 months you would become eligible for the BPM 401K. The company also offers parking, a gym membership from Burn Fitness in Santa Monica, cell phone reimbursement and bonus opportunities, paid out based on individual and company performance on a quarterly basis.

All applicants must be authorized to work in the United States. The company does not offer visa sponsorship at this time."

POSITION: Senior Program Manager. Small company style so you'll wear Product Owner, Project Manager and Software System Engineer hats
LOCATION: Work Remote- work from anywhere USA. Ideal cities; Washington, DC area, Orlando FL, Denver, CO. US Citizenship is required. This position requires the ability to obtain and maintain a security clearance during early employment which we sponsor.

Company Overview
STILMAN Advanced Strategies develops software based on Linguistic Geometry (LG), a unique Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach. Our core technology generates predictive, tactically correct Courses of Action (COAs) that dynamically adapt in response to changes in missions and actions taken by the intelligent opposition. These tools support mission planning, rehearsal, training and execution use cases for military commanders across echelons and services. Our applications have been shown to deliver unique value to the warfighter due to the quality of generated COAs, UX/UI design that makes it easy to fully comprehend complex COA results and to define mission inputs, as well as ease of deployment and integration with other system with well-defined modern APIs.

Our small, distributed team has been developing and continually improving these software applications since 1999. We pride ourselves on the quality of our software and we are excited as we continue this development with US Navy, US Army, Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and other agencies to further enhance, integrate, and deploy these products.

The Role: Senior Program Manager
We are looking to bring on a dedicated Senior Program Manager (aka Product Owner / Software System Engineer) to work closely with our software developers on our primary software applications that include web app that leverages modern UI technologies, UX concepts, GIS/mapping, communications protocols, data formats, and military concepts, as well as backend components with custom Artificial Intelligence (AI) engine, military modeling and simulation framework (M&S), and integration capabilities for our own front end and for 3rd party systems. This web-based system encompasses a large feature set for map-centric scenario construction and editing, 2D and 3D animated visualization, real time collaboration, COA analytics, wargaming, and integration with other military and simulation systems. As the feature set grows, we need to ensure that user experience for both basic and advanced users is as smooth as possible, little training is needed, and the military users can intuitively use the tool to help them think about tactics rather than spending their time thinking about how to use the tool.

In this role, you will become the Subject Matter Expert (SME) of military Courses of Action analysis, wargaming and simulation software systems. Prior military tactical experience and/or understanding of the military operations and capabilities would be a strong asset, although not required.

You will communicate with the clients to assist with gathering feedback and new requirements and decomposing them into actionable, well-defined user stories and tasks. You will work with the development team to design solutions to customer needs, help document the system and feature design, and communicate it with key stakeholders outside of the company. You will take part in design of UI/UX and military modeling for new features or redesigning existing ones based on customer needs, feedback, and your own recommendations for usability improvements. You will work directly with the development team to manage and prioritize backlog, track developer progress and guide them in making decisions to ensure end software closely matches user needs. As a superuser of our software you will use the software, communicate insights for the development team, and demonstrate the functionality to the current or prospective customers. You will support our integration efforts through close communication with the product owners and software engineers of the other companies to make sure that the end product fits customer needs, and to represent and advocate for the technical approach designed by our development team.

Company Overview
STILMAN Advanced Strategies develops software based on Linguistic Geometry (LG), a unique Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach. Our core technology generates predictive, tactically correct Courses of Action (COAs) that dynamically adapt in response to changes in missions and actions taken by the intelligent opposition. These tools support mission planning, rehearsal, training and execution use cases for military commanders across echelons and services. Our applications have been shown to deliver unique value to the warfighter due to the quality of generated COAs, UX/UI design that makes it easy to fully comprehend complex COA results and to define mission inputs, as well as ease of deployment and integration with other system with well-defined modern APIs.

Our small, distributed team has been developing and continually improving these software applications since 1999. We pride ourselves on the quality of our software and we are excited as we continue this development with US Navy, US Army, Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and other agencies to further enhance, integrate, and deploy these products.

The Role: Military Veteran Modeling & Simulation Leader
We are looking to bring on a dedicated Veteran Leader (aka Product Owner / Software System Engineer) to work closely with our software developers on our primary software applications that include web app that leverages modern UI technologies, UX concepts, GIS/mapping, communications protocols, data formats, and military concepts, as well as backend components with custom Artificial Intelligence (AI) engine, military modeling and simulation framework (M&S), and integration capabilities for our own front end and for 3rd party systems. This web-based system encompasses a large feature set for map-centric scenario construction and editing, 2D and 3D animated visualization, real time collaboration, COA analytics, wargaming, and integration with other military and simulation systems. As the feature set grows, we need to ensure that user experience for both basic and advanced users is as smooth as possible, little training is needed, and the military users can intuitively use the tool to help them think about tactics rather than spending their time thinking about how to use the tool.

In this role, you will become the Subject Matter Expert (SME) of military Courses of Action analysis, wargaming and simulation software systems. Prior military tactical experience and/or understanding of the military operations and capabilities would be a strong asset, although not required.

You will communicate with the clients to assist with gathering feedback and new requirements and decomposing them into actionable, well-defined user stories and tasks. You will work with the development team to design solutions to customer needs, help document the system and feature design, and communicate it with key stakeholders outside of the company. You will take part in design of UI/UX and military modeling for new features or redesigning existing ones based on customer needs, feedback, and your own recommendations for usability improvements. You will work directly with the development team to manage and prioritize backlog, track developer progress and guide them in making decisions to ensure end software closely matches user needs. As a superuser of our software you will use the software, communicate insights for the development team, and demonstrate the functionality to the current or prospective customers. You will support our integration efforts through close communication with the product owners and software engineers of the other companies to make sure that the end product fits customer needs, and to represent and advocate for the technical approach designed by our development team.

13143,Product Marketing Manager,Product Marketing Manager,"Bring Fresh food to more people!

The fresh, perishable food industry is massive and growing faster than the packaged consumer goods industry. But, to date, most supply chain technologies have been built for non-perishable goods. This technology gap results in suboptimal decision making-causing billions of dollars of excess food purchasing and waste every year.

So we built Afresh (http://afreshtechnologies.com/) with a simple argument: a supply chain company, built specifically for fresh food and using the cutting edge of technology could massively reduce food waste, make nutritious food more accessible, and multiply the profitability of food companies at the same time.

We’ve grown fast. In our deployments with large grocery chains we have reduced food waste by 25-40% and massively boosted customer profits! Our system is now live with several large regional grocers representing hundreds of stores and billions of revenue. Our backers include Innovation Endeavors (former Google CEO Eric Schmidt’s firm) and Baseline Ventures (first money in Stitchfix, SoFi, Heroku, Instagram).

We are a passionate team united by our mission to make an impact in the food system. We hope you'll join us!

What will you be doing?
As Afresh’s first Product Marketing Manager you will be responsible for go-to-market strategy, market analysis, event marketing and positioning of Afresh’s core solution as well as our expanded product portfolio. You will establish a product marketing function and team that focuses on revenue growth and scale by creating timely, authoritative, defensible product knowledge and collaborate with key functions across the organization to build and iterate on a winning go-to-market strategy. We are looking for someone who enjoys tackling new challenges and working in a fast-paced environment that is changing every day.

-Build user guides and other -training materials for Afresh's end customers that clearly communicates our product's value and differentiated functionality.Oversee the launches of new products and features, including content creation, and campaign strategy.

What skills do you need?3-5 years of industry experience in product marketing.
-A demonstrably successful -background in B2B SaaS product marketingHighly collaborative, self-starter, with a tremendous desire and excitement to learn and improve.A passion for precision and details, with the ability to manage multiple priorities and tasks simultaneously.Strong interpersonal and relationship building skills and a proven track record partnering with product teams to develop roadmap and take products to launch.Experience developing messaging and use cases.Outstanding written and verbal skills and presentation abilitiesStrong alignment with our core values: Kindness, Candor, Proactivity and Humility.

Background
About 30-40% of food produced worldwide is thrown away, causing nearly a trillion dollars of economic losses, trillions of gallons of wasted water, and billions of tons of greenhouse gas emissions. In the US, about 40% of all food waste occurs at the retail level and downstream, largely driven by insufficient technology and manual processes.

Afresh seeks to tackle some of these big problems around food waste. Born out of Stanford's Computer Science PhD program, Afresh is the first Fresh food supply chain company. We bring the cutting edge of artificial intelligence to Fresh food to minimize food waste.

Our machine learning-powered supply chain solutions are tailored for the many nuances and complexities of perishables. Our first product is a store-level replenishment tool that optimizes the ordering of items in fresh categories - produce, meat, deli, dairy, bakery, and prepared foods. The goal is to minimize waste and maximize in-stock rate, and consequently, profit.
So far, our results are in line with that goal! Our technology is deployed across the country and used every day—our customers have reduced their food waste by 33-50%+ and significantly improved their profits.

We're growing fast: we're in partnership with several large regional grocers representing 500+ stores and >$10B in revenue. Our backers include Innovation Endeavors (former Google CEO Eric Schmidt’s firm) and Baseline Ventures (first money in Stitchfix, SoFi, Heroku, Instagram).
We earnestly believe that Afresh represents a one-of-a-kind opportunity to have massive social impact, at profitable scale, by employing novel technology—and to have a ton of fun along the way."

With decades of both domain and AI expertise, we work with thousands of organizations across a wide range of industries.

Join our team! At Nuance, we are constantly reinventing how people connect with technology and with each other.

Job Summary:
Summary:
Nuance is currently building a completely new product which combines our successful speech recognition technology with language understanding to take even more work off doctor’s shoulders. This product will be highly innovative and is intended to achieve something currently not available anywhere in the medical (or any other) market.

The person we are looking for will be in a position to influence the direction this new product is taking.

In that area, the specific role is focused around supporting the interaction between the new software stack and existing HIS / EHR platforms. Therefore, previous experience with HL7, FHIR and/or similar data exchange protocols used in the medical sector are a must. Experience designing or working on cloud services or other highly scalable & reliable software is a plus.

Environment: You will be working with an enthusiastic and highly skilled team in an international company. The team designing the new product is currently located in Vienna, Austria and Boston, USA. Ability to communicate clearly and succinctly both in written and spoken English is a must. Experience working with a distributed team is a plus.

Responsibilities:
Data exchange infrastructure for data retrieval from and insertion into EHR / HIS platforms.
Teamworking skills with a problem-solving attitude
Excellent verbal and written communications skills in English
Software development at senior experience level
Software design support for cloud-based, highly available services
Contributions towards requirement elicitation, use case and user story creation
Defining and working with microservices
