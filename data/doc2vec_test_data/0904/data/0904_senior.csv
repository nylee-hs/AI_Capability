Are YOU The Right Fit?


You need to be a top performer. Is that you? If you think so, then you’re probably not. Now if you KNOW so, then ask yourself if this sounds familiar: Are you tired of glass ceilings in your current job? Do you feel held back? Are you curious about what you're REALLY capable of?


Think deep. Have you ever wanted to be a part of the thrill? Are you inspired by the story of the Silicon Valley startups?

Scalable businesses change the world more than political movements, more than nations, even more than religions.

973,Senior Backend Engineer: Platform / Scalability,Senior Back-End Engineer,"About Instrumental:
Instrumental is creating the future of manufacturing, empowering hardware companies to optimize their factories through the use of artificial intelligence. Thanks to Instrumental, companies can:

increase yields (the percent of goods passing inspection);
decrease dark yield (the escape of goods that should have failed inspection); and,
trace everything (to narrowly scope recalls to only those goods affected).

Our product is delighting customers, who now have access to technology that produces results previously unattainable. The Instrumental customer list is growing across a diverse set of manufacturing applications, and we are asking you to help us scale to the needs of that entire market.

We’re a small but mighty team that consistently works collaboratively, are supportive of each other, and are all highly energized by the opportunity for such a large impact. We actively work to promote an inclusive environment.

About the role:
Instrumental is looking for a Senior Backend Engineer with JVM expertise to help scale our infrastructure to handle millions of pieces of manufacturing data per day.

While we do not ask for familiarity with all of the following, our stack includes a number of web services written in Scala / Play, AWS (mostly ECS and RDS), Elasticsearch, a Python machine learning cluster, and TypeScript on our frontend. Instrumental Engineering values good tools, robust tests, and frequent deploys.

Here's what we think is required for success:

Three or more years professional experience writing and maintaining stable production-quality code.
Familiarity with distributed systems.
Experience scaling JVM application(s) from processing millions of items per month to millions of items per day.
Motivation to solve big problems in an analog industry at an early-stage environment

These might not apply to you yet, but you're eager to grow:

You have experience with different AWS offerings—like ECS, RDS, Lambda(s), and Kinesis.
You've suffered through classpath problems before; when you hear ""eden"", your first thoughts are of memory issues, not gardens. You've got battle scars from in-the-weeds JVM odysseys.
You've written enough Scala that you're not afraid of library method signatures that contain CanBuildFrom and, with sufficient googling, could use it yourself.
You’ve maintained a good relationship with both relational and non-relational databases.

What you’ll do and how you’ll do it:

Solve problems, whether refactoring or feature building, through clean, concise, and well-tested code. Recent examples include establishing a new server infrastructure for machine learning algorithms and adding an alerting API for our customers.
Lead an endeavor to improve customer experience, fatten our data pipeline, expose new APIs, or scale our infrastructure, taking product specifications through the prototyping phase to production-ready solutions.
Communicate progress in the development cycle from sprint planning to daily stand-ups to retrospectives.
Grow as an engineer by learning from others and by becoming somebody that people go to for technical help.

Relevant Technologies:
JVM/Scala, Play, AWS, Docker, Elasticsearch, Postgres"

4733,Sr. Machine Learning Software Engineer,Sr. ML Software Engineer,"Wish you could apply your Machine Learning and Software Engineering experience to help dogs everywhere? Now you can. If you have a passion for working quickly to design, develop, train and deploy machine learning models to help pets lead longer, healthier and happier lives, we want to hear from you. Check out your dream job below.

A BIT ABOUT OUR PET INSIGHT TEAM

Pet Insight is a team of data scientists, technologists, and vets that have partnered with Whistle Labs - the premier pet care IoT technology, Banfield Pet Hospital - the largest general veterinary practice in the United States, and pet owners - citizen scientists, to conduct the largest population health study in pet care.

The Pet Insight Project has been built fresh, from the ground up, with modern best-in-class technologies. In a short time, our small team (with the support of the larger Kinship and Whistle teams) has created a brand-new system, built around our unique machine learning algorithms that have been trained and validated on an unmatched volume of real-world data. While there's plenty of work left to be done, we are building out and scaling up, and our system is already helping us to understand the life of a pet on a second-by-second basis, in a level of detail never explored before. We're looking for an expert in creating and training data-driven models to lead the extension of our current technologies and develop new and innovative ways that ML can help improve the lives of pets. As part of our small team of like-minded data scientists, you'll also help deploy these models to production to help process time-series sensor data, classify images, label sounds, or even help understand videos depending on the specific use case.

HOW YOU'LL CREATE A BETTER WORLD FOR PETS

The work you'll do here is critically important because ""pets can't talk."" In turn, Pet Insight is using artificial intelligence to develop advanced deep learning models ( see FilterNet https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/9/2498 ) to uncover important links between pet behaviors, activity, and health. This understanding is critical to telling a more complete ""health story"" and empowering pet owners to better care for the animals they love. It also has the power to transform conventional veterinary medicine, by moving the profession beyond generally accepted practice to a whole new level of personalized care driven by objective, evidence-based, precision-medicine.

Your job will be to leverage our one of a kind dataset to help shape and build applications that use machine learning models to help improve the lives of pets by:

Extending and improving Pet Insight's state-of-the-art deep learning architecture for activity recognition to provide owners with even more valuable information about their pets' behaviors.

Developing, implementing, and deploying machine learning models that leverage our unique combination of behavior data and medical record data to detect and alert owners to potential health problems using changes in the pets' behaviors.

Performing statistical analysis on the outputs of these machine learning models to help update, re-train, and then deploy new ML models to help improve the overall data processing pipeline.

Leading development, design, and experimentation to quickly prototype and test new and innovative ways that machine learning can help improve the lives of pets.

Improve and extend machine learning models used to predict a dog's behavior from sensor-based time-series data.

Developing methodologies for inferring a pet's health from its behaviors using retrospective analyses with medical records.

Quickly creating prototypes and conduct experiments to investigate the feasibility of new and innovative ways to keep pets healthier and happier using machine learning.

Contributing to the creation, deployment, and scaling of machine learning and predictive algorithms in a production environment.

Using Python and many of the common scientific packages extensively, including PyTorch, Pandas, and scikit-learn to output the data we calculate for each dog to a distributed file system so that we can use big-data tools like Spark to help us understand it.

Where appropriate, you will use other AWS services, and we are open to maturing and improving our systems via other technologies.

8888,"Senior Software Engineer, Records","Senior Software Engineer, Records","Our mission is to protect life.
We’re out to make the world a safer place by solving big problems and taking on the public safety challenges of our time. From our company's inception building the TASER device to a full suite of hardware and software solutions, we are focused on providing police agencies with the state-of-the-art devices and services they need to successfully serve and protect us. In the next few years, we're going to eliminate the burden of paperwork in policing, so officers can increase the time they spend building relationships and serving in their communities. We’ll put video at the heart of the police record so our justice system can get to the truth faster. And we won't stop innovating until the bullet is rendered obsolete.

It’s a big mission, but it’s one we’ll pursue relentlessly every single day.

Your Impact
Today, public safety officers spend up to 2/3 of their time on the job filling out paperwork. Not only is this tedious for officers, but the never-ending pile of paperwork reduces the amount of time they can spend out in the field, protecting their communities. That’s why we’re building Axon Records, a brand-new cloud-based web platform that cuts down on paperwork so that officers can spend more time prioritizing the safety of our communities.

As a Senior Software Engineer on the Axon Records Search team, you will build a high-performance, scalable search platform to equip law enforcement officers with the information they need to document critical incidents, report their interactions, and protect their communities. And that’s just the beginning. By building a data analytics platform to gather real-time insights from criminal data to help agencies solve crimes and keep patrol officers safe in the field, you will help transform the future of public safety.

Imagine the year 2030. Advanced technology has automated more and more routine tasks to put officers back in the community, dramatically improving the quality and safety of our lives. Artificial Intelligence connects the dots and surfaces insights to help prevent crime and keep officers and citizens informed and protected.

Sound exciting? We think so too. Check out this short video to learn more about where we're heading, and apply now to join a team that's turning this vision into a reality.

12227,Sr. Machine Learning Data Scientist,Sr. ML Data Scientist,"Wish you could apply your Machine Learning and Software Engineering experience to help dogs everywhere? Now you can. If you have a passion for working quickly to design, develop, train and deploy machine learning models to help pets lead longer, healthier and happier lives, we want to hear from you. Check out your dream job below.

A BIT ABOUT OUR PET INSIGHT TEAM
Pet Insight is a team of data scientists, technologists, and vets that have partnered with Whistle Labs - the premier pet care IoT technology, Banfield Pet Hospital - the largest general veterinary practice in the United States, and pet owners - citizen scientists, to conduct the largest population health study in pet care.

The Pet Insight Project has been built fresh, from the ground up, with modern best-in-class technologies. In a short time, our small team (with the support of the larger Kinship and Whistle teams) has created a brand-new system, built around our unique machine learning algorithms that have been trained and validated on an unmatched volume of real-world data. While there's plenty of work left to be done, we are building out and scaling up, and our system is already helping us to understand the life of a pet on a second-by-second basis, in a level of detail never explored before. We're looking for an expert in creating and training data-driven models to lead the extension of our current technologies and develop new and innovative ways that ML can help improve the lives of pets. As part of our small team of like-minded data scientists, you'll also help deploy these models to production to help process time-series sensor data, classify images, label sounds, or even help understand videos depending on the specific use case.

HOW YOU'LL CREATE A BETTER WORLD FOR PETS
The work you'll do here is critically important because ""pets can't talk."" In turn, Pet Insight is using artificial intelligence to develop advanced deep learning models (see FilterNet https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/9/2498) to uncover important links between pet behaviors, activity, and health. This understanding is critical to telling a more complete ""health story"" and empowering pet owners to better care for the animals they love. It also has the power to transform conventional veterinary medicine, by moving the profession beyond generally accepted practice to a whole new level of personalized care driven by objective, evidence-based, precision-medicine.

Your job will be to leverage our one of a kind dataset to help shape and build applications that use machine learning models to help improve the lives of pets by:

Extending and improving Pet Insight's state-of-the-art deep learning architecture for activity recognition to provide owners with even more valuable information about their pets' behaviors.
Developing, implementing, and deploying machine learning models that leverage our unique combination of behavior data and medical record data to detect and alert owners to potential health problems using changes in the pets' behaviors.
Performing statistical analysis on the outputs of these machine learning models to help update, re-train, and then deploy new ML models to help improve the overall data processing pipeline.
Leading development, design, and experimentation to quickly prototype and test new and innovative ways that machine learning can help improve the lives of pets.
Improve and extend machine learning models used to predict a dog's behavior from sensor-based time-series data.
Developing methodologies for inferring a pet's health from its behaviors using retrospective analyses with medical records.
Quickly creating prototypes and conduct experiments to investigate the feasibility of new and innovative ways to keep pets healthier and happier using machine learning.
Contributing to the creation, deployment, and scaling of machine learning and predictive algorithms in a production environment.
Using Python and many of the common scientific packages extensively, including PyTorch, Pandas, and scikit-learn to output the data we calculate for each dog to a distributed file system so that we can use big-data tools like Spark to help us understand it.
Where appropriate, you will use other AWS services, and we are open to maturing and improving our systems via other technologies.

WHO WE NEED TO CHART THE FUTURE OF PET CARE

We strive to hire people who are passionate about our mission: Creating A Better World for Pets. We believe what we do is just as important as how we do it, and we aim to hire people who value our cultural pillars:
