We’re out to make the world a safer place by solving big problems and taking on the public safety challenges of our time. From our company's inception building the TASER device to a full suite of hardware and software solutions, we are focused on providing police agencies with the state-of-the-art devices and services they need to successfully serve and protect us. In the next few years, we're going to eliminate the burden of paperwork in policing, so officers can increase the time they spend building relationships and serving in their communities. We’ll put video at the heart of the police record so our justice system can get to the truth faster. And we won't stop innovating until the bullet is rendered obsolete.

It’s a big mission, but it’s one we’ll pursue relentlessly every single day.

Your Impact
Today, public safety officers spend up to 2/3 of their time on the job filling out paperwork. Not only is this tedious for officers, but the never-ending pile of paperwork reduces the amount of time they can spend out in the field, protecting their communities. That’s why we’re building Axon Records, a brand-new cloud-based web platform that cuts down on paperwork so that officers can spend more time prioritizing the safety of our communities.

As a Senior Software Engineer on the Axon Records Search team, you will build a high-performance, scalable search platform to equip law enforcement officers with the information they need to document critical incidents, report their interactions, and protect their communities. And that’s just the beginning. By building a data analytics platform to gather real-time insights from criminal data to help agencies solve crimes and keep patrol officers safe in the field, you will help transform the future of public safety.

Imagine the year 2030. Advanced technology has automated more and more routine tasks to put officers back in the community, dramatically improving the quality and safety of our lives. Artificial Intelligence connects the dots and surfaces insights to help prevent crime and keep officers and citizens informed and protected.

Sound exciting? We think so too. Check out this short video to learn more about where we're heading, and apply now to join a team that's turning this vision into a reality.

You need to be a top performer. Is that you? If you think so, then you’re probably not. Now if you KNOW so, then ask yourself if this sounds familiar: Are you tired of glass ceilings in your current job? Do you feel held back? Are you curious about what you're REALLY capable of?

Scalable businesses change the world more than political movements, more than nations, even more than religions.


Do you crave culture? Great, join us in San Diego. We have a 14,000 square foot complex with a gym, sauna, shower, free snacks, coffee, arcade games, ping-pong, and even mid-day yoga classes. Special guests come in once a month to educate on a range of unique topics too, like meditation, mindfulness, fitness, spirituality, personal development and much more.

Are YOU The Right Fit?


You need to be a top performer. Is that you? If you think so, then you’re probably not. Now if you KNOW so, then ask yourself if this sounds familiar: Are you tired of glass ceilings in your current job? Do you feel held back? Are you curious about what you're REALLY capable of?


Think deep. Have you ever wanted to be a part of the thrill? Are you inspired by the story of the Silicon Valley startups? Do you envy the excitement of the 'accidental billionaires' who will be remembered for centuries? Scalable businesses change the world more than political movements, more than nations, even more than religions.


Do you hate offices? Great, you can work from home. Grab your headset and join us on zoom for daily meetings. We also use Asana and Slack for smooth management and communications. Work from your living room couch in your comfy pajamas, or from Lake Como in Italy if you like.


Do you crave culture? Great, join us in San Diego. We have a 14,000 square foot complex with a gym, sauna, shower, free snacks, coffee, arcade games, ping-pong, and even mid-day yoga classes.

Intelligence Studio is a horizontally scalable, cross-cloud technology-agnostic platform built with trusted open source components like Kubernetes, Spark, Airflow, MLflow, and TensorFlow. It allows data scientists to focus on doing data science by taking care of essential concerns like data access, logging, configuration, resource negotiation, dependency management, orchestration, and testing.

This self-service, data science platform solution connects in with partners in a shared ecosystem, scales by usage, and has the building blocks to help our data scientists and clients move from creation to deployment of a data science project, at scale.

Interested in what your project will be? Read on!

Recently, we implemented a multi-user cloud-based integrated development environment with code completion and debugging built-in. And now we’re focused on building a fine-grained entitlements and access control system for big data.

This position is a fantastic opportunity for an experienced engineer to work with creative engineers and cutting-edge technologies, so we need hands-on technologists who are strong in software engineering fundamentals, Big Data, and DevOps. And did we mention the cold brew on tap? You’ll also get all the free coffee (hot or cold) you can want, all day long.

WHAT YOU WILL BE DOING:
Building software and integrations in a cloud-based Microservices environment for Big Data applications
Actively participate in team code reviews and enforce quality standards
Work within a cross-functional team to author clear and purposeful epics/stories
Promote and enforce best practices in development and operations

973,Senior Backend Engineer: Platform / Scalability,Senior Back-End Engineer,"About Instrumental:
Instrumental is creating the future of manufacturing, empowering hardware companies to optimize their factories through the use of artificial intelligence. Thanks to Instrumental, companies can:

increase yields (the percent of goods passing inspection);
decrease dark yield (the escape of goods that should have failed inspection); and,
trace everything (to narrowly scope recalls to only those goods affected).

Our product is delighting customers, who now have access to technology that produces results previously unattainable. The Instrumental customer list is growing across a diverse set of manufacturing applications, and we are asking you to help us scale to the needs of that entire market.

We’re a small but mighty team that consistently works collaboratively, are supportive of each other, and are all highly energized by the opportunity for such a large impact. We actively work to promote an inclusive environment.

About the role:
Instrumental is looking for a Senior Backend Engineer with JVM expertise to help scale our infrastructure to handle millions of pieces of manufacturing data per day.

While we do not ask for familiarity with all of the following, our stack includes a number of web services written in Scala / Play, AWS (mostly ECS and RDS), Elasticsearch, a Python machine learning cluster, and TypeScript on our frontend. Instrumental Engineering values good tools, robust tests, and frequent deploys.

Here's what we think is required for success:

Three or more years professional experience writing and maintaining stable production-quality code.
Familiarity with distributed systems.
Experience scaling JVM application(s) from processing millions of items per month to millions of items per day.
Motivation to solve big problems in an analog industry at an early-stage environment

These might not apply to you yet, but you're eager to grow:

You have experience with different AWS offerings—like ECS, RDS, Lambda(s), and Kinesis.
You've suffered through classpath problems before; when you hear ""eden"", your first thoughts are of memory issues, not gardens. You've got battle scars from in-the-weeds JVM odysseys.
You've written enough Scala that you're not afraid of library method signatures that contain CanBuildFrom and, with sufficient googling, could use it yourself.
You’ve maintained a good relationship with both relational and non-relational databases.

What you’ll do and how you’ll do it:

Solve problems, whether refactoring or feature building, through clean, concise, and well-tested code. Recent examples include establishing a new server infrastructure for machine learning algorithms and adding an alerting API for our customers.
Lead an endeavor to improve customer experience, fatten our data pipeline, expose new APIs, or scale our infrastructure, taking product specifications through the prototyping phase to production-ready solutions.
Communicate progress in the development cycle from sprint planning to daily stand-ups to retrospectives.
Grow as an engineer by learning from others and by becoming somebody that people go to for technical help.

About Instrumental:
Instrumental is creating the future of manufacturing, empowering hardware companies to optimize their factories through the use of artificial intelligence. Thanks to Instrumental, companies can:

increase yields (the percent of goods passing inspection);
decrease dark yield (the escape of goods that should have failed inspection); and,
trace everything (to narrowly scope recalls to only those goods affected).

Our product is delighting customers, who now have access to technology that produces results previously unattainable. The Instrumental customer list is growing across a diverse set of manufacturing applications, and we are asking you to help us scale to the needs of that entire market.

With ~30 people we are a small but mighty team, so if you are looking for a place where you can work with friendly people and have outsize impact on entire industries then keep reading!

About the role:
As a full stack JavaScript engineer at Instrumental, you'll apply your expertise in application development to implement and guide the roadmap of our factory software running on the most secure assembly lines of the world. We deploy fast -- the software you write on Monday will be executing in mass production by Friday.

Our factory stack is: Angular/Typescript for UI, NodeJS for local backend, C++ for hardware integrations (surfaced as node modules), and Docker for application delivery and service orchestration.

This isn't a solo job -- you will be working together not only with fellow engineers developing the factory application, but with backend developers, operations, and product staff in a quest to improve the way that things are made, wherever they are made.

What you can expect in the first few months:

Designing and implementing the frontend and local backend for workflows to be used by assembly line workers.
Working with the cloud platform and web app teams to provide more control over and visibility into factory systems from thousands of miles away.

Demonstrated ability to lead teams in speccing & delivering software projects while keeping stakeholders in the loop.
A relentless desire to automate (or the foundation and desire to learn!).
Ability to effectively communicate complex ideas to technical and non-technical individuals alike.

More details on requirements:

HTML/CSS/JS: although we automate as much as we can, there are points that require input from, and deliver insights to, personnel on the assembly line, and you should be comfortable shipping code for their use.
NodeJS: you should be able to add the backend endpoints and business logic needed to enable new frontend features.
Demonstrated Leadership: the people who thrive here tend to be self-driven individuals who know when to seek guidance, but can also work with a team to autonomously tackle large projects.

If you have a passion for working quickly to design, develop, train and deploy machine learning models to help pets lead longer, healthier and happier lives, we want to hear from you. Check out your dream job below.

A BIT ABOUT OUR PET INSIGHT TEAM

Pet Insight is a team of data scientists, technologists, and vets that have partnered with Whistle Labs - the premier pet care IoT technology, Banfield Pet Hospital - the largest general veterinary practice in the United States, and pet owners - citizen scientists, to conduct the largest population health study in pet care.

The Pet Insight Project has been built fresh, from the ground up, with modern best-in-class technologies. In a short time, our small team (with the support of the larger Kinship and Whistle teams) has created a brand-new system, built around our unique machine learning algorithms that have been trained and validated on an unmatched volume of real-world data. While there's plenty of work left to be done, we are building out and scaling up, and our system is already helping us to understand the life of a pet on a second-by-second basis, in a level of detail never explored before. We're looking for an expert in creating and training data-driven models to lead the extension of our current technologies and develop new and innovative ways that ML can help improve the lives of pets. As part of our small team of like-minded data scientists, you'll also help deploy these models to production to help process time-series sensor data, classify images, label sounds, or even help understand videos depending on the specific use case.

HOW YOU'LL CREATE A BETTER WORLD FOR PETS

The work you'll do here is critically important because ""pets can't talk."" In turn, Pet Insight is using artificial intelligence to develop advanced deep learning models ( see FilterNet https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/9/2498 ) to uncover important links between pet behaviors, activity, and health. This understanding is critical to telling a more complete ""health story"" and empowering pet owners to better care for the animals they love. It also has the power to transform conventional veterinary medicine, by moving the profession beyond generally accepted practice to a whole new level of personalized care driven by objective, evidence-based, precision-medicine.

Your job will be to leverage our one of a kind dataset to help shape and build applications that use machine learning models to help improve the lives of pets by:

Extending and improving Pet Insight's state-of-the-art deep learning architecture for activity recognition to provide owners with even more valuable information about their pets' behaviors.

Developing, implementing, and deploying machine learning models that leverage our unique combination of behavior data and medical record data to detect and alert owners to potential health problems using changes in the pets' behaviors.

Performing statistical analysis on the outputs of these machine learning models to help update, re-train, and then deploy new ML models to help improve the overall data processing pipeline.

Leading development, design, and experimentation to quickly prototype and test new and innovative ways that machine learning can help improve the lives of pets.

Improve and extend machine learning models used to predict a dog's behavior from sensor-based time-series data.

Developing methodologies for inferring a pet's health from its behaviors using retrospective analyses with medical records.

Quickly creating prototypes and conduct experiments to investigate the feasibility of new and innovative ways to keep pets healthier and happier using machine learning.

Contributing to the creation, deployment, and scaling of machine learning and predictive algorithms in a production environment.

Using Python and many of the common scientific packages extensively, including PyTorch, Pandas, and scikit-learn to output the data we calculate for each dog to a distributed file system so that we can use big-data tools like Spark to help us understand it.

Where appropriate, you will use other AWS services, and we are open to maturing and improving our systems via other technologies.

If you have a passion for working quickly to design, develop, train and deploy machine learning models to help pets lead longer, healthier and happier lives, we want to hear from you. Check out your dream job below.

A BIT ABOUT OUR PET INSIGHT TEAM
Pet Insight is a team of data scientists, technologists, and vets that have partnered with Whistle Labs - the premier pet care IoT technology, Banfield Pet Hospital - the largest general veterinary practice in the United States, and pet owners - citizen scientists, to conduct the largest population health study in pet care.

The Pet Insight Project has been built fresh, from the ground up, with modern best-in-class technologies. In a short time, our small team (with the support of the larger Kinship and Whistle teams) has created a brand-new system, built around our unique machine learning algorithms that have been trained and validated on an unmatched volume of real-world data. While there's plenty of work left to be done, we are building out and scaling up, and our system is already helping us to understand the life of a pet on a second-by-second basis, in a level of detail never explored before. We're looking for an expert in creating and training data-driven models to lead the extension of our current technologies and develop new and innovative ways that ML can help improve the lives of pets. As part of our small team of like-minded data scientists, you'll also help deploy these models to production to help process time-series sensor data, classify images, label sounds, or even help understand videos depending on the specific use case.

HOW YOU'LL CREATE A BETTER WORLD FOR PETS
The work you'll do here is critically important because ""pets can't talk."" In turn, Pet Insight is using artificial intelligence to develop advanced deep learning models (see FilterNet https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/9/2498) to uncover important links between pet behaviors, activity, and health. This understanding is critical to telling a more complete ""health story"" and empowering pet owners to better care for the animals they love. It also has the power to transform conventional veterinary medicine, by moving the profession beyond generally accepted practice to a whole new level of personalized care driven by objective, evidence-based, precision-medicine.

Labelbox is building software infrastructure for industrial data science teams to do data labeling for the training of neural networks. When we build software, we take for granted the existence of collaborative tools to write and debug code. The machine learning workflow has no standard tooling for labeling data, storing it, debugging models and then continually improving model accuracy. Enter Labelbox. Labelbox's vision is to become the default software for data scientists to manage data and train neural networks in the same way that GitHub or text editors are defaults for software engineers.

We are backed by some of the finest people in the Silicon Valley who work at Andreessen Horowitz, Gradient Ventures (Google's AI fund), Kleiner Perkins and First Round Capital.

We believe that AI has the power to transform every aspect of our lives - from healthcare to agriculture. The exponential impact of artificial intelligence will mean mammograms can happen quickly and cheaply irrespective of the limited number of radiologists there are in the world and growers will know the instant that disease hits their farm without even being there.

At Labelbox, we’re building a platform to accelerate the development of this future. Rather than requiring companies to create their own expensive and incomplete homegrown tools, we’ve created a training data platform that acts as a central hub for humans to interface with AI. When humans have better ways to input and manage data, machines have better ways to learn.

These tools support mission planning, rehearsal, training and execution use cases for military commanders across echelons and services. Our applications have been shown to deliver unique value to the warfighter due to the quality of generated COAs, UX/UI design that makes it easy to fully comprehend complex COA results and to define mission inputs, as well as ease of deployment and integration with other system with well-defined modern APIs.

Our small, distributed team has been developing and continually improving these software applications since 1999. We pride ourselves on the quality of our software and we are excited as we continue this development with US Navy, US Army, Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and other agencies to further enhance, integrate, and deploy these products.

Why Join DISCO

We intend to build a multi-billion dollar business and think you should come along for the ride because:

We were the first movers to a cloud-based platform that has caused mass disruption within our market.

Our CEO is a true market visionary. He graduated with a computer science degree at the age of 15 and followed with a JD from Harvard Law School at the age of 19. His unparalleled insights into the fundamental issues in legal and the potential of technology and artificial intelligence to change our market at its core provide the guiding light for DISCO's long-term strategy.

We believe that product delivery professionals including product managers, product designers and engineers differ from one another by at least a factor of 10. At DISCO, we only hire the top 1%. We pay them well and also include equity, which means , pay them well, and with equity, everyone has effectively been getting a raise each and every day. Given our product-focused mindset, product professionals are very much stars of the show. Given our product first mindset, product professionals are very much stars of the show. Our logo, the circle and square, represents the best lawyers and the best product professionals in the world.

We measure product delivery velocity by dollars of revenue per line of code, vs simply lines of code. We hire many more product managers and designers per engineer than most companies to drive a very thoughtful and deliberate product design and development process that ensures we are going to make money when we ship products. We hire many more product managers and designers per engineer than most companies to ensure that our engineers have a disambiguated product intent when they are building.

As a rule, we don't commit to external product delivery dates as we believe that unnecessarily constrains our creativity from both a product and technology point of view.

At DISCO respect isn't earned; it is assumed. Good humans inherently treat everyone respectfully. This is a very important concept at DISCO.

Given the high caliber of talent, the cutting-edge cloud-based technology stack, and thoughtful and novel product and design approach, you'll find yourself learning and growing at a rate you've not likely experienced in your career. Given that we only hire professionals that are passionate about their craft, you'll truly enjoy building a great software product and get in the best ""career shape"" of your life.

We use the ""2 Pizza Team"" organization design where small autonomous teams own a piece of a product or platform and ship software at rates comparable to a very lean and scrappy startup. We achieve consistency across these teams in the areas of design, product-wide use cases and technical concerns through a strategically focused set of overlay functions.

Finally, while we're an incredibly fast-growing organization, as a rule, we do not work crazy long hours. We believe in continuous product delivery, continuous product planning and design, continuous regular sleep schedules, continuous regular vacation, and continuous fun if you're passionate about your craft.

4351,Senior Project Consultant (with UN-OICT United Nations Technology Innovation Labs),Senior Project Consultant,"Background


The UN Technology Innovation Labs (UNTIL) are designed to move humanity forward, faster by focusing on the use of innovative technology to solve some of humanity's most pressing needs.
Recognizing that innovation plays a critical role in moving the United Nations forward and acknowledging that the United Nations’ ability to innovate and engage in partnerships will be a significant factor in the efforts to successfully implement the SDGs (and the broader mandates of the United Nations), the UNTIL Lab programme is designed to support the journey to review, build, adapt and implement technology solutions to address problems that Member States are facing.
To engage the gears of innovation proactively, the United Nations Office of information and Communication Technology (OICT) is establishing “United Nations Technology Innovation Labs” (UNTIL). Using cutting-edge frontier technology currently available, such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, internet of things, fintech, and the use of drones to answer Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) challenges, UNTIL aims at using technological innovation to resolve day to day issues. In line with the ICT Strategy (A/69/517) approved by the UN General Assembly at its 69th session, OICT is establishing new UNTIL Labs locations
in Europe, Africa, and Asia. Labs in other regions are planned for a second implementation phase in response to specific Member State’s host requests.
In 2015, the 193 United Nations (UN) the Member States adopted 17 global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. The SDGs cover a broad set of challenges such as economic inclusion, diminishing natural resources, geopolitical instability, environmental degradation, and the multi-faceted impacts of climate change. Each goal has specific targets to be achieved over the next 15 years and they define the agenda for inclusive economic growth through to 2030.
The rapid advancement of technology in the past decade has changed the way organizations operate. UN General Assembly in its resolution 68/220[1] recognizes the vital role that science, technology, and innovation, including environmentally sound technologies, can play in the development and in facilitating efforts to address global challenges. To improve on the delivery of UN mandates to create meaningful impact, a programme was designed to leverage on the latest technology and harness global expertise and effort for the development of open source solutions, tools, and services to achieve the SDGs. This unified innovation programme is being piloted in the form of United Nations Technology Innovation Labs (UNTIL), championed by the United Nations Office for Information and Communication and Technologies (UN-OICT).
UN-OICT and UNDP have partnered with MaGIC of the Malaysian government to establish a lab at Cyberjaya, Malaysia. The mission of UNTIL Malaysia is to build solutions to needs related to UN mandates, namely in SDGs, for several thematic areas that are central to Malaysia and the region. UNTIL Malaysia aims to bring the right project interventions, global technology, expertise, and network through which and entrepreneurs to work on meaningful development of sustainable solutions. All solutions will be based on open-source standards, will use open data, and will eventually be available to all UN Member States.
This specific assignment of Senior Project Consultant is to engage as an expert who will help UNTIL Malaysia to build a technology ecosystem in the country and in the region. He/She will provide technical leadership in the UNTIL Malaysian program and the upcoming projects under the agreed thematic areas.
Each UNTIL is based on different humanitarian themes that are central to the needs of each individual Labs specific geolocation. The Labs will use AI, Blockchain, IoT and other high-tech tools to develop technology solutions that will be open source and available globally to all Member States once operational.


Duties and Responsibilities


The goal of the UN Technology Innovation Labs is to function as a start-up environment and create a platform for collaborative problem solving between UN resources, the Private sector, Academia, and Civil Society. Each Lab will facilitate linking this platform with innovators and mentors from across the globe as well as to facilitate the global exchange of ideas and resources. UNTIL will function as a Laboratory and tool, offering advisory support and guidance that will facilitate problem-solving through hands-on-workshops, immersion-learning, and incubated projects.
Each Lab will focus on specific thematic areas of concern to the host country. Themes will not be duplicated to the extent possible in other global Labs, but technology will be shared and transferred creating an ecosystem of innovative technology tools and testbeds for proof of concepts. UNTIL Malaysia will focus on four different thematic areas: Ethical fashion, Sustainable Tourism, Smart cities – Circular Economy, and Financial Inclusion.

in Europe, Africa, and Asia. Labs in other regions are planned for a second implementation phase in response to specific Member State’s host requests.
In 2015, the 193 United Nations (UN) the Member States adopted 17 global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. The SDGs cover a broad set of challenges such as economic inclusion, diminishing natural resources, geopolitical instability, environmental degradation, and the multi-faceted impacts of climate change. Each goal has specific targets to be achieved over the next 15 years and they define the agenda for inclusive economic growth through to 2030.
The rapid advancement of technology in the past decade has changed the way organizations operate. UN General Assembly in its resolution 68/220[1] recognizes the vital role that science, technology, and innovation, including environmentally sound technologies, can play in the development and in facilitating efforts to address global challenges. To improve on the delivery of UN mandates to create meaningful impact, a programme was designed to leverage on the latest technology and harness global expertise and effort for the development of open source solutions, tools, and services to achieve the SDGs. This unified innovation programme is being piloted in the form of United Nations Technology Innovation Labs (UNTIL), championed by the United Nations Office for Information and Communication and Technologies (UN-OICT).
UN-OICT and UNDP have partnered with MaGIC of the Malaysian government to establish a lab at Cyberjaya, Malaysia. The mission of UNTIL Malaysia is to build solutions to needs related to UN mandates, namely in SDGs, for several thematic areas that are central to Malaysia and the region. UNTIL Malaysia aims to bring the right project interventions, global technology, expertise, and network through which and entrepreneurs to work on meaningful development of sustainable solutions. All solutions will be based on open-source standards, will use open data, and will eventually be available to all UN Member States.
This specific assignment of Senior Project Consultant is to engage as an expert who will help UNTIL Malaysia to build a technology ecosystem in the country and in the region. He/She will provide technical leadership in the UNTIL Malaysian program and the upcoming projects under the agreed thematic areas.
Each UNTIL is based on different humanitarian themes that are central to the needs of each individual Labs specific geolocation. The Labs will use AI, Blockchain, IoT and other high-tech tools to develop technology solutions that will be open source and available globally to all Member States once operational.


Duties and Responsibilities


The goal of the UN Technology Innovation Labs is to function as a start-up environment and create a platform for collaborative problem solving between UN resources, the Private sector, Academia, and Civil Society. Each Lab will facilitate linking this platform with innovators and mentors from across the globe as well as to facilitate the global exchange of ideas and resources. UNTIL will function as a Laboratory and tool, offering advisory support and guidance that will facilitate problem-solving through hands-on-workshops, immersion-learning, and incubated projects.
Each Lab will focus on specific thematic areas of concern to the host country. Themes will not be duplicated to the extent possible in other global Labs, but technology will be shared and transferred creating an ecosystem of innovative technology tools and testbeds for proof of concepts.

Power is seeking a seasoned User Experience Designer to join the team at our HQ office outside of Philadelphia, PA. This designer will have the ability to define how internal users will interact with our homegrown systems. We are looking for a collaborative UX designer, with front end development skills, who is passionate about creating phenomenal tools that people genuinely want to use.

What we do here
Fancy a unique work environment that is constantly pushing you to try something new? or perhaps stretch your skills by designing for an industry you’ve always wanted to improve?

At Power, we build our own application suite of products to run our entire business. We build complete solutions for finance, recruiting, sales, contact center, and even meeting software. These are just some of the areas you’ll get an opportunity to tackle.

We also design solutions for augmented reality in the home, satellite photo measurements, and artificial intelligence suggestion engines.

We get to dip our toes in many different fascinating areas and solve unique challenging problems that would on their own, be standalone apps or companies. We’re a tech powerhouse built inside a remodeling company.

Our teams are distributed so we live and die by our ability to successfully collaborate. We communicate using our own slack-like chat client. We use our own handoff tools to support our User Experience team to create and collaborate with the development and business groups.

Like design systems? We also believe that a design system unites product teams around a common visual language, so we’ve built 2 open source projects to support this effort called Playbook.

The user experience team is a small and diverse team made up of UX Designers and UX Engineers. We value diversity of all types at Power and our team is made up of a kind, thoughtful group of people with a wide range of backgrounds. We actively try to find people with different perspectives and experiences to the ones we already have.

With a distributed group it’s important to connect in person, so we fly the whole team to Philadelphia 3 times a year for our week-long event called Create, which focuses on connecting and learning from each other and the business.

At Power we have all the upsides of a startup, move fast, ship rapidly, and iterate quickly, but with the benefit of an established organization that is well funded and profitable.

The biggest perk of working at Power is that we have a small, talented team with a very large audience. This means you have the ability to make a huge impact on the product and the company while having really interesting and challenging problems to work on. We believe deeply in what we do and we're all in this to build something lasting, sustainable, and positive.

Power has been awarded Computerworld’s Best Places to Work in IT, Fortune Magazine’s #1 Workplace for Millennials, one of Glassdoor’s Best Places to Work, one of Inc. 5000’s Fastest Growing Private Companies, and Philadelphia Magazine Coolest Companies.

The Partnership for Public Service is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization with a compelling mission: we are working to help make the federal government a more dynamic, innovative and effective servant of the American people, and we have a great team that helps make it happen.
Our staff is diverse in experience and perspective, but at our core we share a lot of the same traits. We are mission-driven, creative, collaborative, optimistic and inclusive.
Our work is strategic, fast-paced and guided by our values:
Passion for public service and our work toward a more effective government.

Promise to be trustworthy, nonpartisan and fiscally responsible.
We hire smart and friendly people who are great at what they do and are good to one another in the process.
POSITION OVERVIEW
Decades of persistent neglect and antiquated systems have left the federal government unable to meet the demands of today’s interconnected, technology-driven world. This dynamic compromises government’s ability to serve the public; if government cannot embrace cutting-edge systems and practices, it hampers delivery of vital services and keeps public servants from using data to make better decisions.
In the federal government today, technology underpins all major initiatives, enabling internal operations and external service delivery. The Partnership for Public Service is uniquely positioned to collaborate with top tech leaders in government, including Chief Information Officers, Chief Technology Officers and Chief Data Officers. We have a growing portfolio of projects focused on critical technology management issues, and we bring together agencies to highlight bright spots and work through common challenges. Our work promotes buy-in among federal leadership for technological change; increases understanding among public servants about emerging technologies and how they can better enable mission delivery; publishes thought leadership to advance federal technology issues; and fosters the use of best practices and innovative models to improve how government recruits, hires, retains, and develops its technology-focused workforce.
In addition to scaling up projects related to building the capacity of technologists at all levels of government, the Partnership for Public Service will undertake a broader effort to create a long-term federal technology transformation strategy. This new strategy will articulate how to prioritize and scale existing Partnership efforts, while adding new programs to address government’s evolving needs.
The Senior Manager for Federal Technology Strategy and Programs is a new position that will oversee the strategic direction, planning and execution of our growing technology-focused portfolio.

Company Overview
STILMAN Advanced Strategies develops software based on Linguistic Geometry (LG), a unique Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach. Our core technology generates predictive, tactically correct Courses of Action (COAs) that dynamically adapt in response to changes in missions and actions taken by the intelligent opposition. These tools support mission planning, rehearsal, training and execution use cases for military commanders across echelons and services. Our applications have been shown to deliver unique value to the warfighter due to the quality of generated COAs, UX/UI design that makes it easy to fully comprehend complex COA results and to define mission inputs, as well as ease of deployment and integration with other system with well-defined modern APIs.

Our small, distributed team has been developing and continually improving these software applications since 1999. We pride ourselves on the quality of our software and we are excited as we continue this development with US Navy, US Army, Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and other agencies to further enhance, integrate, and deploy these products.

The Role: Senior Systems Engineer, Software / Product Owner
We are looking to bring on a dedicated Senior System Engineer, Software / Product Owner to work closely with our software developers on our primary software applications that include web app that leverages modern UI technologies, UX concepts, GIS/mapping, communications protocols, data formats, and military concepts, as well as backend components with custom Artificial Intelligence (AI) engine, military modeling and simulation framework (M&S), and integration capabilities for our own front end and for 3rd party systems. This web-based system encompasses a large feature set for map-centric scenario construction and editing, 2D and 3D animated visualization, real time collaboration, COA analytics, wargaming, and integration with other military and simulation systems. As the feature set grows, we need to ensure that user experience for both basic and advanced users is as smooth as possible, little training is needed, and the military users can intuitively use the tool to help them think about tactics rather than spending their time thinking about how to use the tool.

In this role, you will become the Subject Matter Expert (SME) of military Courses of Action analysis, wargaming and simulation software systems. Prior military tactical experience and/or understanding of the military operations and capabilities would be a very strong asset, although not required.

You will communicate with the clients to assist with gathering feedback and new requirements and decomposing them into actionable, well-defined user stories and tasks. You will work with the development team to design solutions to customer needs, help document the system and feature design, and communicate it with key stakeholders outside of the company. You will take part in design of UI/UX and military modeling for new features or redesigning existing ones based on customer needs, feedback, and your own recommendations for usability improvements. You will work directly with the development team to manage and prioritize backlog, track developer progress and guide them in making decisions to ensure end software closely matches user needs. As a superuser of our software you will use the software, communicate insights for the development team, and demonstrate the functionality to the current or prospective customers. You will support our integration efforts through close communication with the product owners and software engineers of the other companies to make sure that the end product fits customer needs, and to represent and advocate for the technical approach designed by our development team.

Key Skills to Have for this Technical role
Military experience required. Officer level, tactical/combat background, simulation training combo strongly preferred, at least one required
Technically savvy in systems and software development

Company Overview
STILMAN Advanced Strategies develops software based on Linguistic Geometry (LG), a unique Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach. Our core technology generates predictive, tactically correct Courses of Action (COAs) that dynamically adapt in response to changes in missions and actions taken by the intelligent opposition. These tools support mission planning, rehearsal, training and execution use cases for military commanders across echelons and services. Our applications have been shown to deliver unique value to the warfighter due to the quality of generated COAs, UX/UI design that makes it easy to fully comprehend complex COA results and to define mission inputs, as well as ease of deployment and integration with other system with well-defined modern APIs.

Our small, distributed team has been developing and continually improving these software applications since 1999. We pride ourselves on the quality of our software and we are excited as we continue this development with US Navy, US Army, Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and other agencies to further enhance, integrate, and deploy these products.

Yet we make sure that the user experience for both basic and advanced users is as smooth as possible, little training is needed, and the officers can intuitively use the tool to help them think about tactics rather than spending their time thinking about how to use the tool.
You will take part in design of new UI/UX for new features or redesigning existing ones based on customer needs and feedback, implementation of front end software using Angular, Bootstrap, Leaflet, and Cesium, performance optimization, work with backend COA-generation software developers on APIs, data representation and protocols, help model military concepts in software, as well as work with 3rd party software developers to find best ways to integrate our systems.

These tools support mission planning, rehearsal, training and execution use cases for military commanders across echelons and services. Our applications have been shown to deliver unique value to the warfighter due to the quality of generated COAs, UX/UI design that makes it easy to fully comprehend complex COA results and to define mission inputs, as well as ease of deployment and integration with other system with well-defined modern APIs.

Our small, distributed team has been developing and continually improving these software applications since 1999.

Company Overview
STILMAN Advanced Strategies develops software based on Linguistic Geometry (LG), a unique Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach. Our core technology generates predictive, tactically correct Courses of Action (COAs) that dynamically adapt in response to changes in missions and actions taken by the intelligent opposition. These tools support mission planning, rehearsal, training and execution use cases for military commanders across echelons and services. Our applications have been shown to deliver unique value to the warfighter due to the quality of generated COAs, UX/UI design that makes it easy to fully comprehend complex COA results and to define mission inputs, as well as ease of deployment and integration with other system with well-defined modern APIs.

Our small, distributed team has been developing and continually improving these software applications since 1999. We pride ourselves on the quality of our software and we are excited as we continue this development with US Navy, US Army, Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and other agencies to further enhance, integrate, and deploy these products.

The Role: Senior Front-End Developer
We are looking to bring on one or more additional Senior Frontend Developers to work on the primary user interface - web app that leverages modern UI technologies, UX concepts, GIS/mapping, communications protocols, data formats, and military concepts. This web app encompasses a large feature set for map-centric scenario construction and editing, 2D and 3D animated visualization, real time collaboration, analytics, integration with other UI and backend systems. Yet we make sure that the user experience for both basic and advanced users is as smooth as possible, little training is needed, and the officers can intuitively use the tool to help them think about tactics rather than spending their time thinking about how to use the tool.
You will take part in design of new UI/UX for new features or redesigning existing ones based on customer needs and feedback, implementation of front end software using Angular, Bootstrap, Leaflet, and Cesium, performance optimization, work with backend COA-generation software developers on APIs, data representation and protocols, help model military concepts in software, as well as work with 3rd party software developers to find best ways to integrate our systems.

LOCATION: Washington, DC area. Work remote- work from home, anywhere USA is fine. Additional ideal cities to Washington, DC are Denver, CO and Orlando FL. US Citizenship is required. This position requires the ability to obtain and maintain a security clearance during early employment which we sponsor.

Company Overview
STILMAN Advanced Strategies develops software based on Linguistic Geometry (LG), a unique Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach. Our core technology generates predictive, tactically correct Courses of Action (COAs) that dynamically adapt in response to changes in missions and actions taken by the intelligent opposition. These tools support mission planning, rehearsal, training and execution use cases for military commanders across echelons and services. Our applications have been shown to deliver unique value to the warfighter due to the quality of generated COAs, UX/UI design that makes it easy to fully comprehend complex COA results and to define mission inputs, as well as ease of deployment and integration with other system with well-defined modern APIs.

Our small, distributed team has been developing and continually improving these software applications since 1999. We pride ourselves on the quality of our software and we are excited as we continue this development with US Navy, US Army, Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and other agencies to further enhance, integrate, and deploy these products.

The Role: Senior Front-End Developer
We are looking to bring on one or more additional Senior Frontend Developers to work on the primary user interface - web app that leverages modern UI technologies, UX concepts, GIS/mapping, communications protocols, data formats, and military concepts. This web app encompasses a large feature set for map-centric scenario construction and editing, 2D and 3D animated visualization, real time collaboration, analytics, integration with other UI and backend systems. Yet we make sure that the user experience for both basic and advanced users is as smooth as possible, little training is needed, and the officers can intuitively use the tool to help them think about tactics rather than spending their time thinking about how to use the tool.
You will take part in design of new UI/UX for new features or redesigning existing ones based on customer needs and feedback, implementation of front end software using Angular, Bootstrap, Leaflet, and Cesium, performance optimization, work with backend COA-generation software developers on APIs, data representation and protocols, help model military concepts in software, as well as work with 3rd party software developers to find best ways to integrate our systems.
