Company Overview
STILMAN Advanced Strategies develops software based on Linguistic Geometry (LG), a unique Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach. Our core technology generates predictive, tactically correct Courses of Action (COAs) that dynamically adapt in response to changes in missions and actions taken by the intelligent opposition. These tools support mission planning, rehearsal, training and execution use cases for military commanders across echelons and services. Our applications have been shown to deliver unique value to the warfighter due to the quality of generated COAs, UX/UI design that makes it easy to fully comprehend complex COA results and to define mission inputs, as well as ease of deployment and integration with other system with well-defined modern APIs.

Our small, distributed team has been developing and continually improving these software applications since 1999. We pride ourselves on the quality of our software and we are excited as we continue this development with US Navy, US Army, Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and other agencies to further enhance, integrate, and deploy these products.

Company Overview
STILMAN Advanced Strategies develops software based on Linguistic Geometry (LG), a unique Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach. Our core technology generates predictive, tactically correct Courses of Action (COAs) that dynamically adapt in response to changes in missions and actions taken by the intelligent opposition. These tools support mission planning, rehearsal, training and execution use cases for military commanders across echelons and services. Our applications have been shown to deliver unique value to the warfighter due to the quality of generated COAs, UX/UI design that makes it easy to fully comprehend complex COA results and to define mission inputs, as well as ease of deployment and integration with other system with well-defined modern APIs.

Our small, distributed team has been developing and continually improving these software applications since 1999. We pride ourselves on the quality of our software and we are excited as we continue this development with US Navy, US Army, Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and other agencies to further enhance, integrate, and deploy these products.
The Role: Senior C++ Software Engineer
We are looking to bring on one or more additional Senior C++ Developers to work on our primary back end applications that include custom Artificial Intelligence (AI) engine, military modeling and simulation framework (M&S), and integration capabilities for our own front end and for 3rd party systems. This system leverages a range of communication protocols, complex data structures and algorithms, GIS & geometric concepts, and high performance optimizations to support a growing range of use cases. You will be expanding our core AI and M&S frameworks to support new domains (from ground forces to ballistic missiles), use cases (from analysis to real-time wargaming), fidelity of modeling of real world environments and entities, and AI-enabled tactics generation. You will also be integrating our software with other M&S systems, military C2 and Intelligence systems, and supporting varied computing environments (from containers in the cloud to embedded computer in a combat vehicle).

STILMAN Advanced Strategies develops software based on Linguistic Geometry (LG), a unique Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach. Our core technology generates predictive, tactically correct Courses of Action (COAs) that dynamically adapt in response to changes in missions and actions taken by the intelligent opposition. These tools support mission planning, rehearsal, training and execution use cases for military commanders across echelons and services. Our applications have been shown to deliver unique value to the warfighter due to the quality of generated COAs, UX/UI design that makes it easy to fully comprehend complex COA results and to define mission inputs, as well as ease of deployment and integration with other system with well-defined modern APIs.

Our small, distributed team has been developing and continually improving these software applications since 1999. We pride ourselves on the quality of our software and we are excited as we continue this development with US Navy, US Army, Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and other agencies to further enhance, integrate, and deploy these products.

The Role: Senior Front-End Developer
We are looking to bring on one or more additional Senior Frontend developers to work on the primary user interface - web app that leverages modern UI technologies, UX concepts, GIS/mapping, communications protocols, data formats, and military concepts. This web app encompasses a large feature set for map-centric scenario construction and editing, 2D and 3D animated visualization, real time collaboration, analytics, integration with other UI and backend systems. Yet we make sure that the user experience for both basic and advanced users is as smooth as possible, little training is needed, and the officers can intuitively use the tool to help them think about tactics rather than spending their time thinking about how to use the tool.
You will take part in design of new UI/UX for new features or redesigning existing ones based on customer needs and feedback, implementation of front end software using Angular, Bootstrap, Leaflet, and Cesium, performance optimization, work with backend COA-generation software developers on APIs, data representation and protocols, help model military concepts in software, as well as work with 3rd party software developers to find best ways to integrate our systems.

116,10445,I,"Research Associate, Ctr for Network Medicine",Research Associate,"The UCSD Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine (CMM) is one of two basic science units in the School of Medicine where world-class researchers study fundamental cellular processes and pathways using a variety of techniques from classical genetics and fluorescence microscopy to high-throughput genomics, systems biology, and crystallography. Our 36 faculty and over 200 postdoctoral scholars, graduate students, and research staff work on the cutting edge of biology, cutting across fields from basic biochemistry and genetics to genomics, systems biology and stem cell biology. The faculty also play a major role in medical and graduate student training, providing educational and programmatic offerings that span several disciplines and provide diversity to meet the interests of a broad spectrum of students and scholars. We constantly seek to recruit highly motivated, technologically-advanced, and deeply interested individuals who are ready to become a part of our dynamic research and educational environment.
The Center for Network Medicine [www.cnetmed.ucsd.edu] is striving towards a goal of understanding the fundamental principles that allow eukaryotic cells to do their business, i.e., iteratively sense, decide, act and learn/adapt. We hypothesize that they do so through an ad hoc molecular interaction network whose architectural principles and computational rules are similar to those used in the layered communication systems in the engineering world. These rules enable noise reduction, error minimization, shielding and encapsulation of breakdowns, control of delays and state explosion, etc. Success in decoding these fundamental rules should not only enable us to complete and 'clean up' the existing incomplete and messy biological networks, but also use these network for simulating and predicting cell behavior. This will usher a new era in network-based diagnostic tools and network-resetting therapeutics for major diseases. On the flip side, knowing how a cell autonomously carries out its business will provide insights into designing new kinds of self-organizing networks (SON) and provide a novel paradigm (beyond artificial neural networks) for developing Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Under close supervision, the incumbent will be supervised in performing basic molecular and cell biology techniques. Techniques include being trained in tissue culture, transfections, expression of proteins in bacteria and mammalian cells, immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, protein purification, protein-protein interactions, real-time quantitative PCR (QPCR), mutagenesis, ELISA studies, reverse transcription QPCR, Southerns, Northerns, synthesis of radioactive probes for hybridization, plasmid subcloning, GFP-fusion protein construction, lambda and M13 subcloning, cell culture, animal cell transfection, rho-zero cell PEG fusions, retrovirus gene transduction, RNAi knockdowns, etc.
Under close supervision, the research associate will also learn to perform immunofluorescent microscopy and live cell imaging (Mitotracker, reactive oxygen sensitive probes, etc) as well as be trained on how to use and maintain laboratory equipment. This position will also be trained to follow safety, environmental, and/or infection control standards. The lab assistant will also will participate in basic animal studies including performing tail tip DNA analysis, necropsy, tissue trimming and histology. The lab assistant will be trained in courses relevant to biosafety, radiation safety, animal welfare, and notebooks of new techniques.
Specifically, this position may involve: assisting in the establishment of CNetMed’s IHC Core; supporting multiple ongoing cell and molecular biology tasks on multiple projects; and assisting in ongoing animal disease model studies within CNetMed.
