17260,"Data Scientist, Junior","Data Scientist, Junior","The Challenge:
Are you excited at the prospect of unlocking the secrets held by a data set? Are you fascinated by the possibilities presented by the IoT, machine learning, and artificial intelligence advances? In an increasingly connected world, massive amounts of structured and unstructured data open up new opportunities. As a data scientist, you can turn these complex data sets into useful information to solve global challenges. Across private and public sectors — from fraud detection, to cancer research, to national intelligence — you know the answers are in the data.
We have an opportunity for you to use your leadership and analytical skills to support an intelligence community (IC) agency's collection and analysis operations. You’ll work closely with your customer to understand their questions and needs, then dig into their data-rich environment to find the pieces of their information puzzle. You’ll write scripts to integrate data, conduct exploratory data analysis to discover hidden patterns, apply machine learning to train predictive models, and use the right combination of tools to turn that set of disparate data points into objective answers to help mission partners make informed decisions. You’ll provide your customer with a deep understanding of their data, what it all means, and how they can use it. Join us as we use data science for good in support of the IC’s global mission.
