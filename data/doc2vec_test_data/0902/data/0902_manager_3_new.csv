Company Overview
STILMAN Advanced Strategies develops software based on Linguistic Geometry (LG), a unique Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach. Our core technology generates predictive, tactically correct Courses of Action (COAs) that dynamically adapt in response to changes in missions and actions taken by the intelligent opposition. These tools support mission planning, rehearsal, training and execution use cases for military commanders across echelons and services. Our applications have been shown to deliver unique value to the warfighter due to the quality of generated COAs, UX/UI design that makes it easy to fully comprehend complex COA results and to define mission inputs, as well as ease of deployment and integration with other system with well-defined modern APIs.

Our small, distributed team has been developing and continually improving these software applications since 1999. We pride ourselves on the quality of our software and we are excited as we continue this development with US Navy, US Army, Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and other agencies to further enhance, integrate, and deploy these products.

The Role: Senior Program Manager
We are looking to bring on a dedicated Senior Program Manager (aka Product Owner / Software System Engineer) to work closely with our software developers on our primary software applications that include web app that leverages modern UI technologies, UX concepts, GIS/mapping, communications protocols, data formats, and military concepts, as well as backend components with custom Artificial Intelligence (AI) engine, military modeling and simulation framework (M&S), and integration capabilities for our own front end and for 3rd party systems. This web-based system encompasses a large feature set for map-centric scenario construction and editing, 2D and 3D animated visualization, real time collaboration, COA analytics, wargaming, and integration with other military and simulation systems. As the feature set grows, we need to ensure that user experience for both basic and advanced users is as smooth as possible, little training is needed, and the military users can intuitively use the tool to help them think about tactics rather than spending their time thinking about how to use the tool.

In this role, you will become the Subject Matter Expert (SME) of military Courses of Action analysis, wargaming and simulation software systems. Prior military tactical experience and/or understanding of the military operations and capabilities would be a strong asset, although not required.

You will take part in design of UI/UX and military modeling for new features or redesigning existing ones based on customer needs, feedback, and your own recommendations for usability improvements. You will work directly with the development team to manage and prioritize backlog, track developer progress and guide them in making decisions to ensure end software closely matches user needs. As a superuser of our software you will use the software, communicate insights for the development team, and demonstrate the functionality to the current or prospective customers. You will support our integration efforts through close communication with the product owners and software engineers of the other companies to make sure that the end product fits customer needs, and to represent and advocate for the technical approach designed by our development team.
