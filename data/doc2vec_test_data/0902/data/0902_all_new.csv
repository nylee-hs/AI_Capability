The fresh, perishable food industry is massive and growing faster than the packaged consumer goods industry. But, to date, most supply chain technologies have been built for non-perishable goods. This technology gap results in suboptimal decision making-causing billions of dollars of excess food purchasing and waste every year.

So we built Afresh (http://afreshtechnologies.com/) with a simple argument: a supply chain company, built specifically for fresh food and using the cutting edge of technology could massively reduce food waste, make nutritious food more accessible, and multiply the profitability of food companies at the same time.

We’ve grown fast. In our deployments with large grocery chains we have reduced food waste by 25-40% and massively boosted customer profits! Our system is now live with several large regional grocers representing hundreds of stores and billions of revenue. Our backers include Innovation Endeavors (former Google CEO Eric Schmidt’s firm) and Baseline Ventures (first money in Stitchfix, SoFi, Heroku, Instagram).

Background
About 30-40% of food produced worldwide is thrown away, causing nearly a trillion dollars of economic losses, trillions of gallons of wasted water, and billions of tons of greenhouse gas emissions. In the US, about 40% of all food waste occurs at the retail level and downstream, largely driven by insufficient technology and manual processes.

Afresh seeks to tackle some of these big problems around food waste. Born out of Stanford's Computer Science PhD program, Afresh is the first Fresh food supply chain company. We bring the cutting edge of artificial intelligence to Fresh food to minimize food waste.

Our machine learning-powered supply chain solutions are tailored for the many nuances and complexities of perishables. Our first product is a store-level replenishment tool that optimizes the ordering of items in fresh categories - produce, meat, deli, dairy, bakery, and prepared foods. The goal is to minimize waste and maximize in-stock rate, and consequently, profit.
So far, our results are in line with that goal! Our technology is deployed across the country and used every day—our customers have reduced their food waste by 33-50%+ and significantly improved their profits.

We're growing fast: we're in partnership with several large regional grocers representing 500+ stores and >$10B in revenue. Our backers include Innovation Endeavors (former Google CEO Eric Schmidt’s firm) and Baseline Ventures (first money in Stitchfix, SoFi, Heroku, Instagram).
We earnestly believe that Afresh represents a one-of-a-kind opportunity to have massive social impact, at profitable scale, by employing novel technology—and to have a ton of fun along the way."," What skills do you need?3-5 years of industry experience in product marketing.

With decades of both domain and AI expertise, we work with thousands of organizations across a wide range of industries.

Join our team! At Nuance, we are constantly reinventing how people connect with technology and with each other. Our AI-powered solutions empower organizations to transform “business as usual.” For decades, the world’s leading financial, healthcare, telecommunications, retailers, and government organizations have trusted Nuance to bring them award-winning solutions that deliver more meaningful outcomes and empower a smarter, more connected world.

Environment: You will be working with an enthusiastic and highly skilled team in an international company. The team designing the new product is currently located in Vienna, Austria and Boston, USA. Ability to communicate clearly and succinctly both in written and spoken English is a must. Experience working with a distributed team is a plus.

Responsibilities:
Data exchange infrastructure for data retrieval from and insertion into EHR / HIS platforms.

Company Overview
STILMAN Advanced Strategies develops software based on Linguistic Geometry (LG), a unique Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach. Our core technology generates predictive, tactically correct Courses of Action (COAs) that dynamically adapt in response to changes in missions and actions taken by the intelligent opposition. These tools support mission planning, rehearsal, training and execution use cases for military commanders across echelons and services. Our applications have been shown to deliver unique value to the warfighter due to the quality of generated COAs, UX/UI design that makes it easy to fully comprehend complex COA results and to define mission inputs, as well as ease of deployment and integration with other system with well-defined modern APIs.

Our small, distributed team has been developing and continually improving these software applications since 1999. We pride ourselves on the quality of our software and we are excited as we continue this development with US Navy, US Army, Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and other agencies to further enhance, integrate, and deploy these products.

Yet we make sure that the user experience for both basic and advanced users is as smooth as possible, little training is needed, and the officers can intuitively use the tool to help them think about tactics rather than spending their time thinking about how to use the tool.

POSITION: Senior Front End Developer
LOCATION: Remote- work from home, anywhere USA is fine. Ideal cities to Denver, CO (HQ) are the Washington, DC area and Orlando FL.
US Citizenship is required. This position requires the ability to obtain and maintain a security clearance during early employment which we sponsor.

Company Overview
STILMAN Advanced Strategies develops software based on Linguistic Geometry (LG), a unique Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach. Our core technology generates predictive, tactically correct Courses of Action (COAs) that dynamically adapt in response to changes in missions and actions taken by the intelligent opposition. These tools support mission planning, rehearsal, training and execution use cases for military commanders across echelons and services. Our applications have been shown to deliver unique value to the warfighter due to the quality of generated COAs, UX/UI design that makes it easy to fully comprehend complex COA results and to define mission inputs, as well as ease of deployment and integration with other system with well-defined modern APIs.

Our small, distributed team has been developing and continually improving these software applications since 1999. We pride ourselves on the quality of our software and we are excited as we continue this development with US Navy, US Army, Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and other agencies to further enhance, integrate, and deploy these products.

The Role: Senior Front-End Developer
We are looking to bring on one or more additional Senior Frontend Developers to work on the primary user interface - web app that leverages modern UI technologies, UX concepts, GIS/mapping, communications protocols, data formats, and military concepts. This web app encompasses a large feature set for map-centric scenario construction and editing, 2D and 3D animated visualization, real time collaboration, analytics, integration with other UI and backend systems. Yet we make sure that the user experience for both basic and advanced users is as smooth as possible, little training is needed, and the officers can intuitively use the tool to help them think about tactics rather than spending their time thinking about how to use the tool.
You will take part in design of new UI/UX for new features or redesigning existing ones based on customer needs and feedback, implementation of front end software using Angular, Bootstrap, Leaflet, and Cesium, performance optimization, work with backend COA-generation software developers on APIs, data representation and protocols, help model military concepts in software, as well as work with 3rd party software developers to find best ways to integrate our systems.

Recognizing that innovation plays a critical role in moving the United Nations forward and acknowledging that the United Nations’ ability to innovate and engage in partnerships will be a significant factor in the efforts to successfully implement the SDGs (and the broader mandates of the United Nations), the UNTIL Lab programme is designed to support the journey to review, build, adapt and implement technology solutions to address problems that Member States are facing.
To engage the gears of innovation proactively, the United Nations Office of information and Communication Technology (OICT) is establishing “United Nations Technology Innovation Labs” (UNTIL). Using cutting-edge frontier technology currently available, such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, internet of things, fintech, and the use of drones to answer Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) challenges, UNTIL aims at using technological innovation to resolve day to day issues. In line with the ICT Strategy (A/69/517) approved by the UN General Assembly at its 69th session, OICT is establishing new UNTIL Labs locations
in Europe, Africa, and Asia. Labs in other regions are planned for a second implementation phase in response to specific Member State’s host requests.
In 2015, the 193 United Nations (UN) the Member States adopted 17 global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. The SDGs cover a broad set of challenges such as economic inclusion, diminishing natural resources, geopolitical instability, environmental degradation, and the multi-faceted impacts of climate change. Each goal has specific targets to be achieved over the next 15 years and they define the agenda for inclusive economic growth through to 2030.
The rapid advancement of technology in the past decade has changed the way organizations operate. UN General Assembly in its resolution 68/220[1] recognizes the vital role that science, technology, and innovation, including environmentally sound technologies, can play in the development and in facilitating efforts to address global challenges. To improve on the delivery of UN mandates to create meaningful impact, a programme was designed to leverage on the latest technology and harness global expertise and effort for the development of open source solutions, tools, and services to achieve the SDGs. This unified innovation programme is being piloted in the form of United Nations Technology Innovation Labs (UNTIL), championed by the United Nations Office for Information and Communication and Technologies (UN-OICT).
UN-OICT and UNDP have partnered with MaGIC of the Malaysian government to establish a lab at Cyberjaya, Malaysia. The mission of UNTIL Malaysia is to build solutions to needs related to UN mandates, namely in SDGs, for several thematic areas that are central to Malaysia and the region. UNTIL Malaysia aims to bring the right project interventions, global technology, expertise, and network through which and entrepreneurs to work on meaningful development of sustainable solutions. All solutions will be based on open-source standards, will use open data, and will eventually be available to all UN Member States.
This specific assignment of Senior Project Consultant is to engage as an expert who will help UNTIL Malaysia to build a technology ecosystem in the country and in the region. He/She will provide technical leadership in the UNTIL Malaysian program and the upcoming projects under the agreed thematic areas.
Each UNTIL is based on different humanitarian themes that are central to the needs of each individual Labs specific geolocation. The Labs will use AI, Blockchain, IoT and other high-tech tools to develop technology solutions that will be open source and available globally to all Member States once operational.


Duties and Responsibilities


The goal of the UN Technology Innovation Labs is to function as a start-up environment and create a platform for collaborative problem solving between UN resources, the Private sector, Academia, and Civil Society. Each Lab will facilitate linking this platform with innovators and mentors from across the globe as well as to facilitate the global exchange of ideas and resources. UNTIL will function as a Laboratory and tool, offering advisory support and guidance that will facilitate problem-solving through hands-on-workshops, immersion-learning, and incubated projects.
Each Lab will focus on specific thematic areas of concern to the host country.
