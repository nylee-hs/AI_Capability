US Citizenship is required. This position requires the ability to obtain and maintain a security clearance during early employment which we sponsor.

Company Overview
STILMAN Advanced Strategies develops software based on Linguistic Geometry (LG), a unique Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach. Our core technology generates predictive, tactically correct Courses of Action (COAs) that dynamically adapt in response to changes in missions and actions taken by the intelligent opposition. These tools support mission planning, rehearsal, training and execution use cases for military commanders across echelons and services. Our applications have been shown to deliver unique value to the warfighter due to the quality of generated COAs, UX/UI design that makes it easy to fully comprehend complex COA results and to define mission inputs, as well as ease of deployment and integration with other system with well-defined modern APIs.

Our small, distributed team has been developing and continually improving these software applications since 1999. We pride ourselves on the quality of our software and we are excited as we continue this development with US Navy, US Army, Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and other agencies to further enhance, integrate, and deploy these products.

The Role: Senior Front-End Developer
We are looking to bring on one or more additional Senior Frontend developers to work on the primary user interface - web app that leverages modern UI technologies, UX concepts, GIS/mapping, communications protocols, data formats, and military concepts.

Yet we make sure that the user experience for both basic and advanced users is as smooth as possible, little training is needed, and the officers can intuitively use the tool to help them think about tactics rather than spending their time thinking about how to use the tool.
You will take part in design of new UI/UX for new features or redesigning existing ones based on customer needs and feedback, implementation of front end software using Angular, Bootstrap, Leaflet, and Cesium, performance optimization, work with backend COA-generation software developers on APIs, data representation and protocols, help model military concepts in software, as well as work with 3rd party software developers to find best ways to integrate our systems.

These tools support mission planning, rehearsal, training and execution use cases for military commanders across echelons and services. Our applications have been shown to deliver unique value to the warfighter due to the quality of generated COAs, UX/UI design that makes it easy to fully comprehend complex COA results and to define mission inputs, as well as ease of deployment and integration with other system with well-defined modern APIs.

Our small, distributed team has been developing and continually improving these software applications since 1999. We pride ourselves on the quality of our software and we are excited as we continue this development with US Navy, US Army, Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and other agencies to further enhance, integrate, and deploy these products.

The Role: Senior Front-End Developer
We are looking to bring on one or more additional Senior Frontend Developers to work on the primary user interface - web app that leverages modern UI technologies, UX concepts, GIS/mapping, communications protocols, data formats, and military concepts. This web app encompasses a large feature set for map-centric scenario construction and editing, 2D and 3D animated visualization, real time collaboration, analytics, integration with other UI and backend systems. Yet we make sure that the user experience for both basic and advanced users is as smooth as possible, little training is needed, and the officers can intuitively use the tool to help them think about tactics rather than spending their time thinking about how to use the tool.
You will take part in design of new UI/UX for new features or redesigning existing ones based on customer needs and feedback, implementation of front end software using Angular, Bootstrap, Leaflet, and Cesium, performance optimization, work with backend COA-generation software developers on APIs, data representation and protocols, help model military concepts in software, as well as work with 3rd party software developers to find best ways to integrate our systems.

Recognizing that innovation plays a critical role in moving the United Nations forward and acknowledging that the United Nations’ ability to innovate and engage in partnerships will be a significant factor in the efforts to successfully implement the SDGs (and the broader mandates of the United Nations), the UNTIL Lab programme is designed to support the journey to review, build, adapt and implement technology solutions to address problems that Member States are facing.
To engage the gears of innovation proactively, the United Nations Office of information and Communication Technology (OICT) is establishing “United Nations Technology Innovation Labs” (UNTIL). Using cutting-edge frontier technology currently available, such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, internet of things, fintech, and the use of drones to answer Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) challenges, UNTIL aims at using technological innovation to resolve day to day issues. In line with the ICT Strategy (A/69/517) approved by the UN General Assembly at its 69th session, OICT is establishing new UNTIL Labs locations
in Europe, Africa, and Asia. Labs in other regions are planned for a second implementation phase in response to specific Member State’s host requests.
In 2015, the 193 United Nations (UN) the Member States adopted 17 global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. The SDGs cover a broad set of challenges such as economic inclusion, diminishing natural resources, geopolitical instability, environmental degradation, and the multi-faceted impacts of climate change. Each goal has specific targets to be achieved over the next 15 years and they define the agenda for inclusive economic growth through to 2030.
The rapid advancement of technology in the past decade has changed the way organizations operate. UN General Assembly in its resolution 68/220[1] recognizes the vital role that science, technology, and innovation, including environmentally sound technologies, can play in the development and in facilitating efforts to address global challenges. To improve on the delivery of UN mandates to create meaningful impact, a programme was designed to leverage on the latest technology and harness global expertise and effort for the development of open source solutions, tools, and services to achieve the SDGs. This unified innovation programme is being piloted in the form of United Nations Technology Innovation Labs (UNTIL), championed by the United Nations Office for Information and Communication and Technologies (UN-OICT).
UN-OICT and UNDP have partnered with MaGIC of the Malaysian government to establish a lab at Cyberjaya, Malaysia. The mission of UNTIL Malaysia is to build solutions to needs related to UN mandates, namely in SDGs, for several thematic areas that are central to Malaysia and the region. UNTIL Malaysia aims to bring the right project interventions, global technology, expertise, and network through which and entrepreneurs to work on meaningful development of sustainable solutions. All solutions will be based on open-source standards, will use open data, and will eventually be available to all UN Member States.
This specific assignment of Senior Project Consultant is to engage as an expert who will help UNTIL Malaysia to build a technology ecosystem in the country and in the region. He/She will provide technical leadership in the UNTIL Malaysian program and the upcoming projects under the agreed thematic areas.
Each UNTIL is based on different humanitarian themes that are central to the needs of each individual Labs specific geolocation. The Labs will use AI, Blockchain, IoT and other high-tech tools to develop technology solutions that will be open source and available globally to all Member States once operational.


Duties and Responsibilities


The goal of the UN Technology Innovation Labs is to function as a start-up environment and create a platform for collaborative problem solving between UN resources, the Private sector, Academia, and Civil Society. Each Lab will facilitate linking this platform with innovators and mentors from across the globe as well as to facilitate the global exchange of ideas and resources. UNTIL will function as a Laboratory and tool, offering advisory support and guidance that will facilitate problem-solving through hands-on-workshops, immersion-learning, and incubated projects.
Each Lab will focus on specific thematic areas of concern to the host country. Themes will not be duplicated to the extent possible in other global Labs, but technology will be shared and transferred creating an ecosystem of innovative technology tools and testbeds for proof of concepts.

Like design systems? We also believe that a design system unites product teams around a common visual language, so we’ve built 2 open source projects to support this effort called Playbook. This role will be responsible for maintaining and growing Playbook.

The user experience team is a small diverse team made up of UX Designers and UX Engineers. We value diversity of all types at Power and our team is made up of a kind, thoughtful group of people with a wide range of backgrounds. We actively try to find people with different perspectives and experiences to the ones we already have.

With a distributed group it’s important to connect in person, so we fly the whole team to Philadelphia 3 times a year for our week-long event called Create, which focuses on connecting and learning from each other and the business.

At Power we have all the upsides of a startup, move fast, ship rapidly and iterate quickly, but with the benefit of an established organization that is well funded and profitable.

The biggest perk of working at Power is that we have a small, talented team with a very large audience. This means you have the ability to make a huge impact on the product and the company while having really interesting and challenging problems to work on. We believe deeply in what we do and we're all in this to build something lasting, sustainable and positive.

10445,I,"Research Associate, Ctr for Network Medicine",Research Associate,"The UCSD Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine (CMM) is one of two basic science units in the School of Medicine where world-class researchers study fundamental cellular processes and pathways using a variety of techniques from classical genetics and fluorescence microscopy to high-throughput genomics, systems biology, and crystallography. Our 36 faculty and over 200 postdoctoral scholars, graduate students, and research staff work on the cutting edge of biology, cutting across fields from basic biochemistry and genetics to genomics, systems biology and stem cell biology. The faculty also play a major role in medical and graduate student training, providing educational and programmatic offerings that span several disciplines and provide diversity to meet the interests of a broad spectrum of students and scholars. We constantly seek to recruit highly motivated, technologically-advanced, and deeply interested individuals who are ready to become a part of our dynamic research and educational environment.
The Center for Network Medicine [www.cnetmed.ucsd.edu] is striving towards a goal of understanding the fundamental principles that allow eukaryotic cells to do their business, i.e., iteratively sense, decide, act and learn/adapt. We hypothesize that they do so through an ad hoc molecular interaction network whose architectural principles and computational rules are similar to those used in the layered communication systems in the engineering world. These rules enable noise reduction, error minimization, shielding and encapsulation of breakdowns, control of delays and state explosion, etc. Success in decoding these fundamental rules should not only enable us to complete and 'clean up' the existing incomplete and messy biological networks, but also use these network for simulating and predicting cell behavior. This will usher a new era in network-based diagnostic tools and network-resetting therapeutics for major diseases. On the flip side, knowing how a cell autonomously carries out its business will provide insights into designing new kinds of self-organizing networks (SON) and provide a novel paradigm (beyond artificial neural networks) for developing Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Under close supervision, the incumbent will be supervised in performing basic molecular and cell biology techniques. Techniques include being trained in tissue culture, transfections, expression of proteins in bacteria and mammalian cells, immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, protein purification, protein-protein interactions, real-time quantitative PCR (QPCR), mutagenesis, ELISA studies, reverse transcription QPCR, Southerns, Northerns, synthesis of radioactive probes for hybridization, plasmid subcloning, GFP-fusion protein construction, lambda and M13 subcloning, cell culture, animal cell transfection, rho-zero cell PEG fusions, retrovirus gene transduction, RNAi knockdowns, etc.
Under close supervision, the research associate will also learn to perform immunofluorescent microscopy and live cell imaging (Mitotracker, reactive oxygen sensitive probes, etc) as well as be trained on how to use and maintain laboratory equipment. This position will also be trained to follow safety, environmental, and/or infection control standards. The lab assistant will also will participate in basic animal studies including performing tail tip DNA analysis, necropsy, tissue trimming and histology. The lab assistant will be trained in courses relevant to biosafety, radiation safety, animal welfare, and notebooks of new techniques.
Specifically, this position may involve: assisting in the establishment of CNetMed’s IHC Core; supporting multiple ongoing cell and molecular biology tasks on multiple projects; and assisting in ongoing animal disease model studies within CNetMed.
MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS
Theoretical knowledge of a life science in a field related to the research being conducted or an equivalent combination of education and experience. Related fields may include any of the following fields of study: molecular biology, genetics, immunology, zoology, and biochemistry.

Animal expertise (breeding, handling, experimentation, genotyping, and weaning).

Proven ability to prepare solutions. Demonstrated knowledge of basic chemistry and math required for preparing solutions.

Capable of operating and maintaining lab equipment such as confocal and quantitative fluorescent microscopes, centrifuges, spectrophotometers, flow cytometer, and scintillation counter.

Ability to maintain laboratory supplies, keeping written records, and data collection.

Basic knowledge of basic chemistry and math required for preparing solutions.

Skill and ability to operate various lab instruments.
Experience with the operation of a personal computer and software application, such as Filemaker, MS Word and Excel. Experience with the Mac platform and applications is preferred over PC.
Strong communication skills (both verbal and written) needed to interact professionally and effectively in the work environment with all levels including faculty, senior researchers, graduate students, undergraduates and those from various backgrounds with tact and diplomacy.

Ability to care for small lab animals, as well as working with animal and human tissues.

Ability to read, and learn to interpret and apply protocols in conducting research. Ability in following stepwise experimental protocols.
Good organizational skills to order and maintain lab equipment and supplies. Ability to perform general lab maintenance, including cleaning and restocking supplies. Experienced working and maintaining a sterile environment.

PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS
