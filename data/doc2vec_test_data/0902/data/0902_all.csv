Company Overview
STILMAN Advanced Strategies develops software based on Linguistic Geometry (LG), a unique Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach. Our core technology generates predictive, tactically correct Courses of Action (COAs) that dynamically adapt in response to changes in missions and actions taken by the intelligent opposition. These tools support mission planning, rehearsal, training and execution use cases for military commanders across echelons and services. Our applications have been shown to deliver unique value to the warfighter due to the quality of generated COAs, UX/UI design that makes it easy to fully comprehend complex COA results and to define mission inputs, as well as ease of deployment and integration with other system with well-defined modern APIs.

Our small, distributed team has been developing and continually improving these software applications since 1999. We pride ourselves on the quality of our software and we are excited as we continue this development with US Navy, US Army, Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and other agencies to further enhance, integrate, and deploy these products.

The Role: Senior Program Manager
We are looking to bring on a dedicated Senior Program Manager (aka Product Owner / Software System Engineer) to work closely with our software developers on our primary software applications that include web app that leverages modern UI technologies, UX concepts, GIS/mapping, communications protocols, data formats, and military concepts, as well as backend components with custom Artificial Intelligence (AI) engine, military modeling and simulation framework (M&S), and integration capabilities for our own front end and for 3rd party systems. This web-based system encompasses a large feature set for map-centric scenario construction and editing, 2D and 3D animated visualization, real time collaboration, COA analytics, wargaming, and integration with other military and simulation systems. As the feature set grows, we need to ensure that user experience for both basic and advanced users is as smooth as possible, little training is needed, and the military users can intuitively use the tool to help them think about tactics rather than spending their time thinking about how to use the tool.

In this role, you will become the Subject Matter Expert (SME) of military Courses of Action analysis, wargaming and simulation software systems. Prior military tactical experience and/or understanding of the military operations and capabilities would be a strong asset, although not required.

You will communicate with the clients to assist with gathering feedback and new requirements and decomposing them into actionable, well-defined user stories and tasks. You will work with the development team to design solutions to customer needs, help document the system and feature design, and communicate it with key stakeholders outside of the company. You will take part in design of UI/UX and military modeling for new features or redesigning existing ones based on customer needs, feedback, and your own recommendations for usability improvements. You will work directly with the development team to manage and prioritize backlog, track developer progress and guide them in making decisions to ensure end software closely matches user needs. As a superuser of our software you will use the software, communicate insights for the development team, and demonstrate the functionality to the current or prospective customers. You will support our integration efforts through close communication with the product owners and software engineers of the other companies to make sure that the end product fits customer needs, and to represent and advocate for the technical approach designed by our development team.

POSITION: Military Veteran Modeling & Simulation Leader. Small company style so you'll wear Product Owner, Project Manager and Software System Engineer hats
LOCATION: Work Remote- work from anywhere USA. Ideal cities; Washington, DC area, Orlando FL, Denver, CO. US Citizenship is required. This position requires the ability to obtain and maintain a security clearance during early employment which we sponsor.

Company Overview
STILMAN Advanced Strategies develops software based on Linguistic Geometry (LG), a unique Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach. Our core technology generates predictive, tactically correct Courses of Action (COAs) that dynamically adapt in response to changes in missions and actions taken by the intelligent opposition. These tools support mission planning, rehearsal, training and execution use cases for military commanders across echelons and services. Our applications have been shown to deliver unique value to the warfighter due to the quality of generated COAs, UX/UI design that makes it easy to fully comprehend complex COA results and to define mission inputs, as well as ease of deployment and integration with other system with well-defined modern APIs.

Our small, distributed team has been developing and continually improving these software applications since 1999. We pride ourselves on the quality of our software and we are excited as we continue this development with US Navy, US Army, Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and other agencies to further enhance, integrate, and deploy these products.

The Role: Military Veteran Modeling & Simulation Leader
We are looking to bring on a dedicated Veteran Leader (aka Product Owner / Software System Engineer) to work closely with our software developers on our primary software applications that include web app that leverages modern UI technologies, UX concepts, GIS/mapping, communications protocols, data formats, and military concepts, as well as backend components with custom Artificial Intelligence (AI) engine, military modeling and simulation framework (M&S), and integration capabilities for our own front end and for 3rd party systems. This web-based system encompasses a large feature set for map-centric scenario construction and editing, 2D and 3D animated visualization, real time collaboration, COA analytics, wargaming, and integration with other military and simulation systems. As the feature set grows, we need to ensure that user experience for both basic and advanced users is as smooth as possible, little training is needed, and the military users can intuitively use the tool to help them think about tactics rather than spending their time thinking about how to use the tool.

In this role, you will become the Subject Matter Expert (SME) of military Courses of Action analysis, wargaming and simulation software systems. Prior military tactical experience and/or understanding of the military operations and capabilities would be a strong asset, although not required.

You will communicate with the clients to assist with gathering feedback and new requirements and decomposing them into actionable, well-defined user stories and tasks. You will work with the development team to design solutions to customer needs, help document the system and feature design, and communicate it with key stakeholders outside of the company. You will take part in design of UI/UX and military modeling for new features or redesigning existing ones based on customer needs, feedback, and your own recommendations for usability improvements. You will work directly with the development team to manage and prioritize backlog, track developer progress and guide them in making decisions to ensure end software closely matches user needs. As a superuser of our software you will use the software, communicate insights for the development team, and demonstrate the functionality to the current or prospective customers. You will support our integration efforts through close communication with the product owners and software engineers of the other companies to make sure that the end product fits customer needs, and to represent and advocate for the technical approach designed by our development team.

At Power, we build our own application suite of products to run our entire business. We build complete solutions for finance, recruiting, sales, contact center, and even meeting software. These are just some of the areas you’ll get an opportunity to tackle.

We also design solutions for augmented reality in the home, satellite photo measurements and artificial intelligence suggestion engines.

We get to dip our toes in many different fascinating areas and solve unique challenging problems that would on their own, be standalone apps or companies. We’re a tech powerhouse built inside a remodeling company.

Our teams are distributed so we live and die by our ability to successfully collaborate. We communicate using our own slack-like chat client. We use our own handoff tools to support our User Experience team to create and collaborate with the development and business groups.

Like design systems? We also believe that a design system unites product teams around a common visual language, so we’ve built 2 open source projects to support this effort called Playbook. This role will be responsible for maintaining and growing Playbook.

We value diversity of all types at Power and our team is made up of a kind, thoughtful group of people with a wide range of backgrounds.

With a distributed group it’s important to connect in person, so we fly the whole team to Philadelphia 3 times a year for our week-long event called Create, which focuses on connecting and learning from each other and the business.

At Power we have all the upsides of a startup, move fast, ship rapidly and iterate quickly, but with the benefit of an established organization that is well funded and profitable.

The biggest perk of working at Power is that we have a small, talented team with a very large audience. This means you have the ability to make a huge impact on the product and the company while having really interesting and challenging problems to work on. We believe deeply in what we do and we're all in this to build something lasting, sustainable and positive.

10445,I,"Research Associate, Ctr for Network Medicine",Research Associate,"The UCSD Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine (CMM) is one of two basic science units in the School of Medicine where world-class researchers study fundamental cellular processes and pathways using a variety of techniques from classical genetics and fluorescence microscopy to high-throughput genomics, systems biology, and crystallography. Our 36 faculty and over 200 postdoctoral scholars, graduate students, and research staff work on the cutting edge of biology, cutting across fields from basic biochemistry and genetics to genomics, systems biology and stem cell biology. The faculty also play a major role in medical and graduate student training, providing educational and programmatic offerings that span several disciplines and provide diversity to meet the interests of a broad spectrum of students and scholars. We constantly seek to recruit highly motivated, technologically-advanced, and deeply interested individuals who are ready to become a part of our dynamic research and educational environment.
The Center for Network Medicine [www.cnetmed.ucsd.edu] is striving towards a goal of understanding the fundamental principles that allow eukaryotic cells to do their business, i.e., iteratively sense, decide, act and learn/adapt. We hypothesize that they do so through an ad hoc molecular interaction network whose architectural principles and computational rules are similar to those used in the layered communication systems in the engineering world. These rules enable noise reduction, error minimization, shielding and encapsulation of breakdowns, control of delays and state explosion, etc. Success in decoding these fundamental rules should not only enable us to complete and 'clean up' the existing incomplete and messy biological networks, but also use these network for simulating and predicting cell behavior. This will usher a new era in network-based diagnostic tools and network-resetting therapeutics for major diseases. On the flip side, knowing how a cell autonomously carries out its business will provide insights into designing new kinds of self-organizing networks (SON) and provide a novel paradigm (beyond artificial neural networks) for developing Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Under close supervision, the incumbent will be supervised in performing basic molecular and cell biology techniques. Techniques include being trained in tissue culture, transfections, expression of proteins in bacteria and mammalian cells, immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, protein purification, protein-protein interactions, real-time quantitative PCR (QPCR), mutagenesis, ELISA studies, reverse transcription QPCR, Southerns, Northerns, synthesis of radioactive probes for hybridization, plasmid subcloning, GFP-fusion protein construction, lambda and M13 subcloning, cell culture, animal cell transfection, rho-zero cell PEG fusions, retrovirus gene transduction, RNAi knockdowns, etc.
Under close supervision, the research associate will also learn to perform immunofluorescent microscopy and live cell imaging (Mitotracker, reactive oxygen sensitive probes, etc) as well as be trained on how to use and maintain laboratory equipment. This position will also be trained to follow safety, environmental, and/or infection control standards. The lab assistant will also will participate in basic animal studies including performing tail tip DNA analysis, necropsy, tissue trimming and histology. The lab assistant will be trained in courses relevant to biosafety, radiation safety, animal welfare, and notebooks of new techniques.
Specifically, this position may involve: assisting in the establishment of CNetMed’s IHC Core; supporting multiple ongoing cell and molecular biology tasks on multiple projects; and assisting in ongoing animal disease model studies within CNetMed.
MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS
Theoretical knowledge of a life science in a field related to the research being conducted or an equivalent combination of education and experience. Related fields may include any of the following fields of study: molecular biology, genetics, immunology, zoology, and biochemistry.

Animal expertise (breeding, handling, experimentation, genotyping, and weaning).

Ability to care for small lab animals, as well as working with animal and human tissues.

Ability to read, and learn to interpret and apply protocols in conducting research. Ability in following stepwise experimental protocols.
Good organizational skills to order and maintain lab equipment and supplies. Ability to perform general lab maintenance, including cleaning and restocking supplies. Experienced working and maintaining a sterile environment.
